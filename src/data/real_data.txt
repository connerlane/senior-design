I can socialize and make friends easily , and I don't have a problem in most social situations . However , I am technically an introvert , so I do prefer being by myself a lot , I can empathize with more quiet and shy people , and I prefer listening over talking a ton which is more of an introverted quality ."	My desire to be in control is my biggest weakness . It can affect my relationships with others as well as the amount of work I take on . Sometimes it can be too much so I stress out .	My greatest talent is my piano playing abilites .

I am easy going but hardworking when I need to be . I can seem cold at times but that is because it takes me a while to warm up to people .	I spend my time primarily making music and playing videogames . I also like to hang out with my friends and watch movies then talk about them .	I am actually studying psychology so it's interesting that you bring that up . My favorite movie right now is Arrival but it sometimes changes depending on what I've seen recently . My favorite TV show is How I Met Your Mother .	I love Arrival because it is a beautiful story that explores topics like empathy and human connection . It's sci-fi which is interesting to me because it uses Aliens to teach humans how to communicate with each other	I don't read much but I really like Agatha Christie books . I don't think	The story keeps you guessing who the murderer is and you can never quite be sure who it is . I like entertainment that makes us question ourselves and this book does that .	I found it on my own in highschool when I was looking for a book to do a report on .	"I'd like to live in Tennessee , probably around Gatlinburg . It is a peaceful , relaxing place with out much hustle and bustle ."	Hiking would be great because the scenery of the Smokey Mountains is beautiful . The atmosphere is much different than where I live now and much more enjoyable I think .	I would lie if it prevented conflict and wouldn't end up hurting someone . I try not to get into situations where I feel like I would need to lie . Lying is uncomfortable but I think there are just some circumstances where it's the best course of action .	"I think "" awful habits "" is rather subjective . I wouldn't consider any of my habits awful but someone else with different sensibilities might ."	I am passionate about music and social justice . I've played guitar for many years and in the past couple years I've started recording . As I've gotten older I've become more aware of people's struggles and I like to think I am more empathetic now than I was when I was younger . I want to work with others to figure out how to ease people's struggles and listen to and understand people's perspectives	My passion for music started because I grew up around musicians . My passion for social justice started because I became more educated on current events and issues .	I could talk with people who don't understand my or others' point of view on current issues	I want to do many things but ultimately I'd describe what I want to do as using psychology to understand and enhance entertainment media and technology	I am always thinking and wondering about human behavior so that is what attracts me to the psychology aspect . what attracts me to the entertainment and technology side is my love for movies / music / TV and interest in emerging technologies	I think I am doing well but there isn't a specific path already laid out for me that I can use to achieve my goals . I am kind of blazing my own trail so to speak . I am majoring in psychology and minoring in media studies so I'm off to a good start .	My favorite course right now is Psychology in the Workplace . Another name for that is Industrial and Organizational Psychology .	Well the course is just beginning but I made a 100 on my first quiz so I'd say I'm doing well and expect to continue doing well .	"My favorite professor is Bill Buskist , who taught my Research Methods class . His class was difficult but he pushed us to do well and was always willing to help us ."	He gave us coursework that made sense and had an obvious rationale . The work he gave us helped us develop necessary skills for psychology . He also respected us and treated us like adults and consequently expected us to act like it	My favorite is working in youth ministry at my church .	I grew up in the youth group so it is really fulfilling to be able to serve and lead there . the youth ministers also appreciate the help which is nice .	My first thought is to spend it on myself but I have a feeling you mean I have to spend it on someone else . If that's the case then I'd spend it on someone much less well off than me .	"I'd buy them any essentials that they need and don't already have . Stuff like outerwear , socks , toothbrush , soap . Maybe I'd pay for a hotel for a little while if they were homeless ."	$ 1000 isn't going to do much for people I know personally because I and all my friends are pretty well of . I feel that $ 1000 could do a lot more for someone less fortuante than me .	My best friend is Braxton .	"He is introverted , like me , but likes to hang out with friends often . He is what many would consider geeky and likes things like LOTR ."	We have similar interests and personalities . We developed a friendship naturally because of this .	I usually become an organizer or motivator . I guess that's a form of leadership but I don't often consider my self a leader in groups . I'd rather not be the leader of a group but if the group is unorganized then I feel the need to get things back on track .	"There would need to be some creative people , some people who are good at implementing ideas , and people that enjoy helping and filling whatever role needs filling . I would want both males and females and I would want people who get along with others well ."	They would say I am considerate and willing to help . they'd also say I am not contradictory or difficult .	When my friends are having a rough time or need something they are currently unable to get for themselves I am there for them to do that . In group settings I go with the flow and when making decisions I don't force my opinions or ideas if I'm the minority .	They'd say I procrastinate and don't take initiative enough .	When reading or studying for school I often put it off because I get distracted . I don't take initiative when I'm stressed or preoccupied with other things because I overthink what I'm supposed to do .	I am much more caring than some people I know and I am skilled in several types of music and a couple instruments . I feel like I may have more self control than some	I think my passiveness is my greatest weakness . I probably let too many opportunities pass by .	Making original music on both guitar and electronically on a DAW .

"I enjoy spending my free time with my friends , specifically my boyfriend . He and I both enjoy watching Netflix ."	"My favorite TV show is Doctor Who . It is sci fi , but also action and a little bit romantic ."	"What I enjoy most about Doctor Who is the main character , The Doctor . He is a whimsical fellow who enjoys taking his companions in his spaceship across time and space seeking adventures ."	My favorite book would have to be To Kill A Mockingbird . It is about a little girl growing up in Alabama during a time where racism and prejudice were very high . It tells the story of her as a child learning about the world around her .	To Kill A Mockingbird is my favorite book because it explains in not so many words the dangers and repercussions of racism and prejudice in the world .	I found this book through high school . It was an assigned reading .	"I could live anywhere in the world , I would more than likely want to live in Ireland . I've always loved the landscape of Ireland , and the accents . Ireland to me is a place of beauty , of tradition , life , and joy ."	I would enjoy meeting the natives of Ireland and seeing how their day to day lives compare to that of Americans .	"I rarely ever lie , but I feel it would be a lie to say I never lie . I do not like lying because it not only makes me feel guilty , but then I am forced to remember whatever it is I was lying about . If I don't lie , I don't have to remember anything ."	"I bite my nails sometimes , though I have almost broken that bad habit ."	I am passionate about animal and human rights .	"The passion for animal and human rights started as a child , when I noticed how unfair the world is and I realized that it takes people like myself to make a change happen ."	"I regularly show my support for several foundations involving these rights , and I share my opinions and feelings with others as opportunities present themselves /"	I want to continue my schooling and go to Graduate school after graduating and getting my Bachelor's	I am attracted to my major of Psychology because I deeply enjoy the study of the mind . The mind is a very complex organ that is ever changing and ever working .	"I am currently in my Junior year of getting my Bachelor's , and in the fall I will be applying to different graduate schools ."	My favorite course is abnormal psychology .	So far I have an A in this class .	"My favorite professor is Mr . Gutman , my spanish teacher from last semester"	"I like this professor because he was nice , helpful , laid-back , and funny ."	My favorite part time job was when I worked at a jewelry store .	I liked this job because it allowed me to work on my social skills as well as gave me very good experience for the future .	I would more than likely spend this money on my grandmother . She is a sweet lady who deserves that and much more .	"I would buy my grandmother whatever she wanted , which would probably be something for her animals , which she loves dearly ."	"I chose my grandmother because she has not had the easiest life , and things have never been handed to her . She is a good person with a big heart , and she would deserve it ."	"My best friend is probably my boyfriend , Josh ."	"My boyfriend Josh is a social , excited person who likes to have a lot of free time . He has a slight temper , but he is goodhearted ."	"He is my best friend because he knows everything there is to know about me , and I know a great deal about him . I trust him more than I trust anyone else I know ."	When working on a team I would prefer to be the leader and simply tell everyone what their part should be . However I normally end up simply being a crucial member to the team because I don't like to seem pushy .	"If I were choosing partners , I would want a mix of imaginative and organized people , so there would be a good balance . The imaginative people are needed so fresh ideas are available , and the organized people are needed so that things get done on time and are well executed ."	"My best qualities would probably be that I am nice , organized , and hardworking ."	"I am regularly told by my boyfriend how much I like things to be organized , and that if I wasn't there to make sure our house was clean , it never would be ."	"I tend to be shy , quiet , and reserved around new people ."	"Whenever I go out , I am almost always told by my boyfriend to open up and relax , because he knows that I am not the best in social situations"	"I believe that I am a good combination of hardworking and laid back , something not found very often"	I typically don 't speak to people I don 't know well	would don't really know	Female	56.30857215	22.91618891	59.93740838	88.63834576	23.37642876	57.52022176	85.46283931	57.4672324	31.14429362	64.17454395	58.30198986	0.29805756	99.13737629	91.74713314	70.75805051	66.93982413	52.30006329	78.81337455	92.41628933	47.77551833	86.30323342	76.8217565	61.39712189	83.12830564	71.23097004	54.38065025	93.24149151	97.55199967	86.08749061	77.20967373	95.36181115	80.03448741	98.57131816	87.85006698	77.49758621	45.44570723	81.55851258	96.20541424	0.529229619	89.02055891	96.32563456	56.04143996	95.79128539	91.12771887	9.332028698	30.88048303	67.6976851	88.63834576	57.52022176	78.81337455	92.41628933	86.30323342	83.12830564	71.23097004	54.38065025	93.24149151	28.84059664Catherine Jackson	"Hi Kaya ! I tend to be more on the introverted side , although I love to be around people . I can be quiet at times when I have a lot on my mind and I need some alone time throughout the day to regroup my thoughts .

I also enjoy it because it shows that people can start over and live a happy life after being put through traumatizing situations .	"I discovered the book through my best friend , Meghan . She read it and suggested that I read it as well so that we can watch the movie together ."	"I could live anywhere in the world , I would live in Italy . I would like to live there because it is beautiful and I love Italian food . I have never been there although I believe the personality would be charming and bright because it is on the ocean and is a very livel y place ."	"I would enjoy exploring , seeing ancient ruins and learning about the history . I love to explore and seeing new things so I would just enjoy walking around to see those things ."	I do not lie because in the past I used to lie and it would always catch up to me . I believe that lying ultimately only hurts yourself and the person you are lying to .	I do not have bad habits because I am too busy to have bad habits . The only habit that I have is biting my finger nails and I do not believe that is necessarily a bad habit compared to something like drinking or smoking .	I am passionate about learning new things so I have a better worldview and I am also passionate about God .	My passion for wanting to learn new things started when I got to college . I was not the smartest in high school and when I got to college I was learning all sorts of new things that expanded my knowledge . My passion for God started because he saved my life from going down a horrible path that would only lead to self destruction .	"To pursue my passion of wanting to learn more , I have become involved in Dr . Fan's lab as a research assistant to learn more about psychology and what the field looks like hands on . To learn more about God I have become a member of Auburn Community Church and I have joined a community group ."	After college I want to be a Psychology Professor	"I love Psychology and I love children , so those two aspects drew me towards the profession to teaching Developmental Psychology"	I believe that I am on a good path towards becoming a professor . I am working my hardest to make good grades and I am also involved in research in order to gain experience in the field .	Developmental Psychology .	I am in the process of taking the course but so far I have an A .	My favorite professor in college is Dr . Buskist of Auburn University .	"I like Dr . Buskist because of his teaching style , his expectations of students , and his relationship with his students . I enjoyed his teaching style because he never read off of the board while teaching , instead he would have free flowing conversations about the material which made it much easier to understand . I also enjoyed his expectations of student because he would refer to us as young professionals which made students feel like they were respected ."	My favorite job was working as an after school teacher at an elementary school .	"I enjoyed the job because I love to work with children . I was able to help them with their homework and play outside with them so it was always fun and I was always learning something new , I also enjoyed it because I had great coworkers ."	I would spent that money on my mother .	I would give that money to my mother to start paying off her debt because she has so much of it . She is a hardworking woman and deserves to have that burden lifted off her shoulders .	I chose my mother because she has always done everything she can for me and my two older sisters . She had sacrificed so much for us and I would do anything I could do to help her .	My best friend is Bekah .	Bekah is very extroverted . She can make friends with anyone and can easily stand up for herself . If she cares about you she would go to the ends of the Earth to do whatever you needed . She is very hardworking and knows that in order to succeed you have to work hard .	She is my best friend because she is fun to be with . I am introverted and she is extroverted so we balance each other out .	When working on a team I prefer to be the leader of the group .	My ideal partners would be hard working and intelligent . I want hard workers on my team so that we can get the job done reasonably without one person having to do all the work and carry the group . I would want my teammates to be intelligent so that they can contribute ideas to whatever project we are working on .	I believe that they would say I am hard working and that I have a big heart .	"I am hard working because every day I do things that would contribute to my future . I am a full time student , a nanny and I am a Research Assistant so I have a very full load everyday . I believe that I have a big heart because I would do anything for anyone that I know , whether I know them very well or not ."	I believe my worst quality would be getting grumpy when I am overly stressed out .	"When I get stressed out , I sometimes take that out on people that are closest to me by getting snappy and saying somethings that I do not mean ."	Unique qualities that I have are that I go above and beyond in everything that I do and that I am a very hard worker .	I believe my biggest weakness is getting befuddled when I get extremely stressed out or do not know exactly what to do .	My greatest talent would be juggling a soccer ball considering I played for 12 years .

I like to read and go hiking . I am a very active person , and I like to hang out with friends . I am creative and I like to do crafts in my spare time ."	"I like to read , hang out with friends , do outdoor activities , do crafts , and watch movies ."	I really like	"I like the songs and dance scenes in musicals , and I like mysteries because I think it's fun to try to solve the crimes and investigate ."	One of my favorite books ever is Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen .	I like the time period it's set in and I think the author was very witty and humorous in writing it . It also has some romance in it which I find fun to read .	"One of my friends recommended it to me because she really enjoyed it . We have very similar taste , so I thought I would check it out . One of my old teachers gave me a copy and I immediately enjoyed it !"	I think	"I would really like to explore the countrysides and the historic nature of Italy . Like I said , I like to take pictures , so I think it would be really fun to just wonder around in the country and see what there is to see . I would also love to go to all the historical tourist attractions and eat all the food !"	"I think sometimes telling a little lie is okay . For example , if your best friend asks how she looks in something , I would tell her she looks good to support her even if it's not the most flattering outfit ."	"I don't think I have a lot of bad habits , but I know sometimes I will smack my gum too loudly or chew food with my mouth open and other small things like that . I don't do these things often but when I catch myself doing them I stop ."	"I am very passionate about helping others . I love to talk to other people and listen to what they're going through to see if I can offer advice or help them in anyway if they need me to . I believe that everyone deserves to be happy within themselves , and I hope that someday I can help people come to terms with that ."	"I always used to be the person my friends would come to for advice . I used to help with homework , friend problems , school problems , things like that , I started to see myself as more of a helper , so I started volunteering at places and helping a more diverse range of people which helped fuel my passion ."	I decided to major in psychology with a minor in human development and family studies because I want to be a school counselor or mental health counselor and be able to turn this passion of helping others into a career that I love .	"I want to go to graduate school to pursue school counselor or mental health counseling and work in a school setting as a guidance counselor . I really like children , and I would love to work more with them ."	"I have worked in a school setting before , and I just really like that kind of environment . I also really enjoy working with children , so I figured a school would be the ideal place for me to work . Like I said , I love helping others , so I thought this career would be the best combination of all these aspects ."	"I personally think I am doing pretty well . I have taken multiple classes that are applicable to this job field , and I have talked with others in this profession and volunteered with them to see if this is really a good fit for me , and I have enjoyed every second !"	I have taken in college is Abnormal Psychology . I found the subject matter to be very interesting and I enjoyed	I did very well . I got an A .	"My Abnormal Psychology professor , Dr . Jennifer Daniels , has been my favorite professor so far during my college career ."	"She was a very funny lady who had a lot of energy and really enjoyed teaching us . She always told us a lot of great stories to help us learn the topics , and she was very smart in what she did . She was always willing to help anyone who needed it ."	My favorite job I have held has been my paid part-time summer job as an Educare Assistant at an elementary school back home .	"It was the first time I got to work in a school setting and really enjoyed it . I had some great coworkers who made every day fun , and the children I got to work with were adorable and always brought a smile to my face . This job was unpredictable from day to day , and I enjoyed getting to do a lot of different things every day ."	I would probably spend that money on my dad .	"I would buy something for his cars or a new technology item . He likes to work on his cars and play around with technology , and he works so hard for us that I would love to give something back to him ."	"My dad is extremely hardworking and rarely gets a chance to relax . I would love to be able to spend that money on him and get him something fun to look forward to when he comes home from work or just something so that he would be able to relax . He doesn't like to buy things for himself but always gives to others , so I would really like to give back to him ."	"My best friend's name is Hannah , and she is my roommate ."	She is really funny and exciting to be around . She has a zest for life that is contagious and always radiates happiness and joy . She is very smart and hardworking and loves to help others and make sure that I'm doing okay . She understands a lot of my feelings about knows what I like and don't like .	"She's always there for me , and I know she always will be . We rarely fight , but if we do we always talk about it openly . She's easy to get along with and fun to be around , and I like spending time with her ."	Usually while working with teams I always assume the role as the leader . This is often something that people shy away from so I feel like I should take charge and make sure things get done .	"My ideal partners would be people who are driven , motivated , and dependable . I want to be able to count on them to get there share done on time and thoroughly . I want them to be committed to our common goal and work hard to achieve it . I hope that they would be open and honest with me so that we can find out what's best for everyone ."	"They would probably say that I am hardworking , creative , funny , smart , and caring ."	"One day after spending a lot of time studying and getting work done at the library , I came home and my roommate had made me dinner . It was really nice of her , and she told me she had done it because she thinks I'm so hardworking and always take care of her so she wanted to do the same for me to show me that she appreciates me ."	My worst quality is probably the fact that I worry too much about a lot of things .	"One time I was talking to my friend and mentioned all the things I was stressed about ( school work , friends , family , work , etc . ) and she made me realize that a lot of these things were out of my control and not worth me worrying about them . She said I worry too much and should try not to freak out about things that I can't be responsible for ."	I believe something unique about me is how caring I am to everyone and how I am very good at empathizing and putting myself in others' shoes .	My biggest weakness is probably being self-conscious . I often worry that something I do is wrong and I sometimes doubt myself .	"My greatest talent that I would use to win in a talent show would probably be playing a musical instrument . I can play several instruments like piano , french horn , trumpet , harmonica , and others , so I feel like music would be what I would use ."

My name is Luke Hentrich and I am a Pre-Pharmacy major at Auburn . I love to listen to all different kinds of music based on how I'm feeling that day . I try to keep a positive outlook on life even when times get tough . However , I often laugh when I have an immense amount of responsibilites which I feel could rub people the wrong way ."	"I enjoy spending my free time in my apartment or at my favorite study spot , Panera , with my friends ."	My favorite show is definitely Grey's Anatomy .	"I love medical dramas . Not necessarily for the romance , but more for the suspense of the surgeries ."	My all time favorite book is Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows .	"This book is my favorite because I love the entire Harry Potter franchise . However , this book has much more action and was a much different reading experience than the others ."	I found the book on my own since I am a huge fan of the franchise . I was in line at the bookstore the day it came out !	"If I could live anywhere , it would be New York City . Even though I am intimidated by new situations , the hustle and bustle of the city life and immense amounts of culture really appeal to me ."	"I would love exploring , trying new cuisines , and meeting people that have different interests from me ,"	"I think that in certain situations it is better to cover up the truth out of circumstances that are not in my control . On a day to day basis , I feel uncomfortable relating information that I feel is internally confidential , such as my personal beliefs on campus activities ."	"I bite my nails a lot , which I know is not very healthy for me . Among other things , I also lay in bed on my phone for hours at a time when I try my hardest to be productive ."	"I'm passionate about my hobbies that include my interests in music genres , which people always are curious about . I also love to explore new places , even though I don't always get the opportunity ."	"My mom gave me my first mp3 player when I was in third grade , and my music obsession basically started from there . My interests in traveling began when I rode on a plane for the first time ."	"I go on iTunes everyday and explore the different types of music on the home page . By traveling , I've been driving to different parts of the Auburn area and take family trips during the summers to new parts of the U . S . I have not seen ."	"After I graduate college , I hope to use my PhD in pharmacy to help others in situations that are outside of their control ."	"The one-on-one patient contact , which is something that has always been intimidating to me but an interest I have always had . I also love the universe of medicine , a system that is in our control but changing with each day ."	"I feel as if I am doing very well on this path . I have really enjoyed my individual science classes , which going into college I was unsure if I would be able to . My time in college has never really felt too overwhelming , and I thing that bodes well for me ."	My favorite course in college so far has been Anatomy and Physiology . The lab specifically peaked my interests unlike any I've had before .	I received an A in the first portion of this class . I am currently enrolled in the second portion this semester .	My favorite professor was Dr . Melissa Blair . She was my World History professor both semesters .	"I loved the way she communicated her love of history to her students . I have always been interested in history in general , but the way she expressed her passion for it was extremely intriguing to me . I never missed a class !"	"I have only had one job in my life , and I was a paid pharmacy technician . It helped me conclude my passion for the job itself ."	The hands on experience of the medical profession . Getting to meet so many different types of people was very challenging but very rewarding . It opened myself up to social situations .	My mother . She has taught me so much in life and I consider her to be my number one fan .	I would buy her a vacation . She deserves a break from her life every now and then .	I respect and look up to her more than I have anyone . She is my favorite person and I think about how she is doing everyday even though I live away from her now .	"I met last year in a common group setting . She and I go to the same church and are on the same level mentally , I guess"	"Kelsey is very passionate about what she does . She is very active in helping those with disabilities , but we both share common interests like music tastes and college experiences ."	"We just understand each other . It is a hard phenomenon to understand , but I feel like she will always be there for me when I need her ."	"On a team , I prefer to be what you would call a "" runner . "" I do not necessarily like to be the vocal leader of a group , but I want to do everything in my power to make a task as successful as possible ."	Every team needs different personalities to succeed . There definitely needs to be a vocal leader of the group ( which I prefer not to be ) as well as many different but committed types of workers . Diversity is key to success .	"They would say that I am always there for them whenever they need assistance . Also , they would say that I am very bold in my statements even though I do not always express them ."	"My peers have always complimented me on my determination . At my workplace , customers would always tell me that they were appreciative of my work ethic , which is something I take immense pride in ."	I always have a straight face when I'm not communicating with others . People have told me that this turns people away .	"On the concourse of Auburn , which is always bustling with people , having a straight face will deter people from expressing their platforms ."	"I believe that I have the abilities to keep a level head in stressful situations , as well as not hold grudges against other out of our best interests ."	Telling others that I am not comfortable joining an organization .	Trivia . I love trivia !

I am often told that I am older for my age and I feel that I don't relate to most of my peers . I am known for being funny , intelligent , and responsible . I am very particular and I do things my way , rather than the way that others would do them . I am socially anxious and I do not enjoy jumping into social situations before I have gotten my barrings ."	I I I I I I I I I I love going to museums .	"Well , it is difficult for me to pick favorites . I prefer to make lists of my favorite things . But if I had to choose I would say "" Tree of Life "" is my favorite movie and "" 30 Rock "" is my favorite TV show ."	""" Tree of Life "" is about the complex relationship between a father and son , which is something I definitely relate to . It also has major religious themes and uses non conventional cinematography to display themes featured in the film . 30 Rock , on the other hand , is incredibly witty and ties in cultural references that truly elevate it as a TV show . It also features one of my favorite female comedians , Tina Fey . Her character is someone I relate to and watching the show helps me take my mind off of things ."	"My favorite book series is "" Harry Potter "" but my favorite individual book is either "" Bossypants "" which is Tina Fey's autobiography or "" Oranges are not the only Fruit "" by Jeanette Winterson ."	""" Harry Potter "" is my favorite because the story line is so well developed as well as the character arks . You can fully immerse yourself in a different world and forge a relationship with the characters . "" Bossypants "" is my favorite because of how humorous Tina Fey is and how she so eloquently writes about her experiences . "" Oranges are not the only Fruit "" is my favorite because it brings up issues about religion and sexuality which I am all too familiar with ."	""" Harry Potter "" was recommended by my sisters and most of my friends . The other two I found on my own , only because they related to my interests ."	"I truly enjoy getting to know a place through and through and I have a difficult time adjusting to new surroundings . I grew up in Los Angeles , California and recently I have been grappling with the idea of moving back . It is so rich with culture , varied groups of people , and an overall sense of wonder"	"I wouldn't say that Los Angeles is my favorite place in the world . There is a field in Brattleboro , VT that I have felt spiritually connected to since I visit in 2010 . I want to go back to this meadow and meditate on my chakras and energy . I believe it is a place that holds a part of my being and I have been longing to go back for years ."	"I generally don't outright lie about things , but sometimes , in order to protect people , I tell a lie . If I know that something isn't beneficial to someone I will keep it to myself or cover it up . I also tend to be less than truthful with my parents about where I am or what I am doing . Occasionally , I will lie to my friends to get out of hanging out with someone because I want to be alone but I don't want to hurt their feelings ."	"I have some less than ideal habits such as biting my cuticles or picking at my hair . But I am also a person who is conscious of their habits and actively works on controlling them . As to my other answers , I only take my sister's clothing without asking and I sometimes call in sick if I am in need of a break ."	"I am passionate about the rights of minorities and those that are disenfranchised . I am passionate about film , art , and music . I am incredibly passionate about child care and parenting tactics . I am passionate about history , especially religious history . I am very passionate about podcasts , specifically podcasts about murder , crime , and missing persons . I am passionate about nutrition and the issues affecting the health of American's . I am passionate about travel and experiencing other cultures ."	"Honestly , most of my passions evolved in childhood or I have found them through my experiences . I am a very passionate person and I have a wide range of interests . When it comes to child care and parenting , I have always been interest in that and I research it to the greatest extent . I have always been concerned about the rights of minorities , being the politically obsessed person that I am . My parents fostered a deep love of many different things in me , for that I am grateful ."	"I try to fill my time when I am not working , at school , or with friends , with my passions . I am currently a History major and I want to teach high school history and then go to seminary . I also want to be the parent of at least six children and I am trying to make the bests choices I can in order to achieve that goal ."	"Well , after I graduate I want to teach high school history . But , I also want to have four children with my future wife . Once my children are in school full time I want to go to seminary and become a priest . I have several dreams and I am hoping I can accomplish them in this lifetime ."	"I am attracted to the ability to instill values in the youth of America . Teachers played a huge role in how successful / happy I was in high school . Forging a connection to my students and making sure I can best prepare them for the real world is my ultimate goal . I also want to teach them how to actually learn , not just test take . In terms of being a priest , I am attracted to the opportunity to guide people and bring them closer to God . Religion can be an incredibly vital part of life ."	"So far , I am doing well . I am in school for what I want to do and I am adequately successful . I am also making connections through my job in order to further my career goals ."	I love	"I haven't gotten a grade yet because it is only the third week of classes . Last semester , my favorite course was my English class and I made an A ."	"Dr . Donna Bohanan , my history professor . She is the sweetest woman and she goes out of her way to make students feel welcome . She is upfront about tests and her lecture style is interesting and similar to storytelling ."	"She has made an effort to actually get to know her students , which is rare in college classes . She knows the material and how to get across her point without being too wordy or broad ."	My favorite job was being the Lay Rector of Happening . It was a spiritual retreat for 10-12 graders .	"I had the opportunity to make a connection with over 200 youths . I organized , planned , and facilitated the weekend . I had the chance to make people feel welcomed , included , and loved . I absolutely loved guiding each and every one of them spiritually and emotionally . It was such an important weekend and to be given the chance to serve it was incredible ."	I think I would spend it on my sisters . I have always wanted to take them on a trip to a new city .	"I would use the money for our gas , Airbnb , and our food . I would hope we could explore the city thoroughly , going to monuments , local shops , and art museums ."	My sisters are the most important people in my life . They have always been their for me and they are my best friends . I want to show them how much I care about them and that they are deserving of the most love and appreciation this world has to offer .	Her name is Isabel Browning Boyd	"She is very logical , funny , and unique . Her world is black and white and she doesn't understand the grey that other's experience . This being said , she is awesome at giving advice and she is supportive , at the end of the day , towards her friends . She is incredibly loyal and we can have hours of meaningful conversation or just sit and watch movies together ."	"We have a lot of similar interests . We need each other's world views in order to complete our frame of sight . We are both logical but I help her understand the grey areas of emotion . We have similar opinions about other people and we are both very perceptive . Overall , we just have a great time together and understand each other ."	"Well , I actually dislike team sports . I always feel like I will let someone down if I make a mistake . So when it comes to sports , I prefer to coach . Other types of teams , I tend to either be the leader or I am in charge of the details and planning ."	"I would need someone who is really proactive and good at handling deadlines , paperwork , and details . That person would have to be task oriented and ready to work hard . Then I would need someone that would want to bounce ideas back and forth with me . We would be the brains and figure out , together , how to work out different issues ."	"Intelligent , funny , deep sense of justice , caring and maternal , understanding and good at giving advice , successful , multi-talented , unique , comfortable in my own skin , unafraid to be who I am and speak my mind , hardworking , a big personality , and slightly messy ."	People tend to say that I am intelligent when I talk about different issues affecting our world . People say I am maternal and caring when I am taking care of someone if they are hurt or upset . People say I am funny and I have a big personality when I am in groups because I like the attention to be on me .	"Brings the attention onto myself , negative , nit picky , lazy , flaky about sticking to plans , bad at following through on tasks , and anxious"	People tend to say I am uptight and anxious when we are in group situations because I don't like people to break rules or bring too much attention to us . People also say I am bad at sticking to plans when I bail last minute . My mom is often mad at me for forgetting to set up an appointment or turn in a form .	I believe that I have a unique ability to interact with infants . I can almost always calm them down and put them to sleep . I have a special bond with babies .

I am pretty lazy but I am willing to go out and do things if it's for another person . I get irritated easily but I try to understand things from others' points of view .	"I like to watch youtube and netflix , play video games , or browse tumblr to look at jokes and cute animals ."	I really like	I love how it shows that everyone is their own person with their own motives . It makes it feel more real .	I really love	"It talks a lot about the theme of futility and how relationships with others can cause a big impact , and it's very entertaining to read ; I can read for hours without wanting a break ."	"My brother saw that I was reading a book he like , so he gave me some of his favorite reads , including that one ."	I think	I think I would just relax the same ways I would down here except maybe sit outside more often .	I grew up with someone who would yell at you for one wrong word . I mix the truth with some lies in many sentences but only when I'm sure the lie couldn't hurt me or the person I'm talking to in some way . I want to ensure that the person I am talking to has as little as possible to have a problem with .	I don't really clean up after myself and I pick at my nails so they're constantly the shortest they can be . I would be happy with no one knowing about either of those .	"I guess if I have to pick something , I like puns a lot ."	"I had a book when I was little full of them and I guess I just kept telling them . When I was in high school , though , I started telling them more because I saw that others were enjoying them ."	"I like to think of a pun for every situation I go into , though I rarely say them aloud ."	"I want to be an accountant , maybe doing taxes for a charity ."	"It follows a routine but you can work on it all throughout the day instead of a strict "" this then that "" kind of thing , and I like the simple numbers ."	"I'm going to get my basic four-year degree , start interning as I get my master's degree and get my certification to be a CPA , then I'll get a job at a small firm and decide if I want to move to a charity or not ."	I really liked	"I got a very high A ! I wasn't very good at the essays , but the short answer questions and the multiple choice just required complete understanding of the subjects we covered , which I did ."	My ethics professor .	"She was open to others' opinions ( even ones like "" I don't see what's wrong with bombing innocent people "" ) and was respectful to everyone . She gave everyone a chance to speak without forcing them to say more than necessary . Plus she had tattoos and unshaven armpits , which is just really cool ."	I loved	"The coworkers were almost all actually friendly , like they actually wanted to talk to me instead of it seeming like they were being forced to by the situation . Also the boss was really laid back but made sure everything was efficient . It helped me open up as a person ."	"My mother is struggling to pay rent , and my sister is trying to move out of the house , so my mother and sister , probably ."	It would just help them pay rent .	They need the money most and they can't get that much money otherwise .	"Definitely my roommate , Madison ."	"She's calm and understanding . She's very nice to everyone and has a good heart , and she likes to talk a lot about science-y things she knows and explain them to me ."	"She doesn't make me feel unwanted , and our personalities go together well ."	"I prefer to do the bulk of the work on the team , but not be the one directing others ; however , I usually end up as the leader ."	One of them would be chill and understanding but decisive and willing to tell others what to do . another would be artistic and make our project look appealing . Maybe one more person to do some research alone with me would be nice .	They will probably say that I'm nice but very passive and irritable sometimes .	Whenever I offer buy something for a friend they say that I'm really nice .	"I'm too passive and I have trouble controlling my tone . Even when I am not slightly angry , I can sometimes sound annoyed ."	Just today my roommate thought I was offended by her joke because of the way I responded even though I was just distracted by trying to find something .	"I don't think it is unique , but I am good at figuring out problems by myself ."	I am afraid to pass others on the sidewalk in case they'll feel offended and get annoyed at me .	"Coming up with quick puns , I suppose ."

I like the idea that there would be a lot of options regarding travelling and adventuring . There are good hiking areas surrounding Montreal , as well as a lot of museums and shopping districts ."	I don't think lying is a good way to get what you want / fix problems . Telling the truth always makes things easier and more agreeable .

"Rachel is someone who has been there for me since the day we met , no matter what I need .

"I am passionate about Jesus Christ , helping others , my friends / family , and accomplishing my goals"	I became a follower of Jesus when I was nine years old and continue to worship and follow Him .

I guess you could say I'm a active person who likes to live a healthy lifestyle . I have a good balance of social and academic hobbies , while also allowing some time to relax . I love to spend time with friends and family . Along with my outgoing personality I am a bit of an introvert , I value time alone and sometimes will prefer a night in instead of going out ."	"My favorite thing to do on my time off is go on a distance run or bike with my friends on the Triathlon team . I also love to hang out with my friends , we will sometimes go to the gym or watch a movie and relax ."	Between 'House' and 'Prison Break' I would have to choose 'House' .	"I enjoy the main character , House , he is the perfect example of how a doctor should not act yet he is considered a widely known diagnostician on the show . The show keeps you interested with unique cases while also giving you a laugh every now and then ."	I just thought	"Well the book basically encompasses everyone's current mindset on how to get over obstacles . For example , you have the common saying , ' When life gives you lemons , make lemonade' , this book basically teaches you that instead of taking something sour and making it sweet enough to handle , learn how to handle the sour and move on to the next challenge . I just thought it was a really interesting viewpoint that you don't hear that often ."	My mother got it for me for Christmas a while back thinking I'd enjoy it .	I could live anywhere in the world it would be on an island . Not an isolated island but an island like St . John in the Virgin Islands . It's so quiet and simple there with the option to go to someplace more exciting and populated like St . Thomas when you felt	"Hiking , running , eating the local foods , and swimming . However , it wouldn't be my favorite place in the world if my loved ones weren't there , so spending time with them would definitely be something I'd enjoy doing ."	"I chose a five because sometimes the truth can be hurtful , so in circumstances where the truth does more harm then good I would chose to lie . However , I do understand that good intentions still do not make lying acceptable ."	"I actually never thought they were awful habits until I started living with roommates . For instance , when I use the microwave I click it off a second before the food is done and the 1 second left will stay on the microwave instead of the current time . My roommates absolutely hate it . Simple tendencies like that seem to be the worst thing ever in the eyes of others , but I really had no idea they were that bad ."	I'm passionate about making the most out of every opportunity . I think the worst feeling ever is feeling like you could've done more then you pushed yourself to do . I constantly try to push my limits and step out of my comfort zone . I never want to waste a minute .	"I was a competitive soccer player and I worked super hard for the commitment I received . However , I injured myself badly and was dropped from my commitment . Instead of becoming depressed , I did everything I could to make the most out of the situation given to me , and worked harder then I ever could in order to change myself into something I'd be proud of again ."	"I've simply started doing all the things I've wanted to do but never had the courage to do before . For instance , running triathlons , volunteering within the psych department and pursing two majors of interest instead of one ."	I want to become a lawyer .	"Every lawyer I've ever met has an incredible work ethic , and a desire to help people in need . I hope to one day be like them . Also , I've always taken an interest in law and the business world and feel like it would be a profession I could fit into ."	"I feel like I'm doing ok , but there is definitely always room for improvement ."	Business law	"I do not have the final grade because I'm still taking it , but as of right now I have an A ."	I forget her name but she is so unique . She's a little bit different but in a good way . She keeps us all very engaged and her lectures are always full of personality . I really enjoy	"As I stated before , she's a little bit different but in a good way . She keeps us all very engaged and her lectures are always full of personality ."	"I worked retail at a small store called 'Daddy Ultra Runners' , I loved the small location and I love to run so I felt"	"As I stated before , I loved the small location and I love to run so I felt at ease in a place where I took interest in the merchandise / cause ."	"Definitely my little brother , Robbie . He has so much potential . He is for sure the smartest out of my entire family ."	I would put the money towards his college tuition so he could focus on his studies instead of worrying about finances .	I chose Robbie because I want him to have the opportunity to go to the best school he can get into . I would never want him to not be able to attend a challenging university because we couldn't afford it and have him settling at a mediocre college .	I have multiple .	They are fun to be around and have the ability to switch my mood from bad to great by just being around me for a couple of minutes .	They look at me for me and still love me unconditionally .	I love to be the play maker .	"I would chose people who are hard workers but also are physically superior from the rest . They need to be good people , but also good on the field as well ."	They would say I'm efficient and straight the point . I wouldn't waste time when getting the help that they might need .	"When I had to take my friend to the hospital , I was the only calm one during the situation and was able to get everyone with who they needed to be with and where they needed to be without any difficulties ."	"I would say I'm too serious , and too competitive . I definitely try to be the best version of myself all the time but I don' t always understand that there needs to be a time where I can just let go ."	Just how I have viewed myself throughout my time in college . I work hard and I'm always busy . Sometimes I don't let myself take a minute to relax .	Not really .

I am currently a student at Auburn University . I enjoy many different things . I like to thing I have a very strong Faith and I enjoy helping other people . I like when things are very simple and traditional . I am easy going , but I also like to work hard and I expect others to work hard as well ."	"I enjoy spending my free time with my friends and family doing things . I like to ride my motorcycle around and I enjoy throwing the football and baseball . Also , relaxing and eating is very important to me ."	I like	I never could really expect what was going to happen and the plot was just amazing . It completely captured my attention .	I dont read too much but I would say my favorite book is The Outliers	It was cool to see the madness behind many of the most successful people in the world and really why they became so successful .	We had to read it for class	I would like to live in Alabama somewhere . I live here now and love everything about the state . I dont think	Living on a big piece of land with my family and having a simple life .	I lie when there is really no other choice in some cases . When I feel like a lie will in the end be more harm then good I will tell the truth .	I dont think that I have bad habits at all . I wake up most of the time before 8 . I get my work done in a timely manner and I am focused and hard working .	I am passionate about service . Specifically in the local community . I am a leader in Auburn's largest community service organization and I have enjoyed serving over the past three years . I am also passionate about learning new things .	It started as a pledge for my fraternity where we were exposed to community service . It was a great experience and I am very glad that was a part of my freshman year . I continued with my passion into my sophomore and junior year and I look to possibly becoming the president of the organization next year .	I have continued my passion of service by helping others serve and allowing more students to get involved . I also have been serving at the local hospital for the past six months and I have just started serving at a local organization that helps children with special needs by giving them the joy of riding horses .	I would love to be a physician .	I think the fact that you have so much power to influence and help the lives of so many people . I also love the idea of being able to travel to different countries to lead a group of students in providing health care to poor people .	"Deciding on this career path has been difficult , but I have always wanted to pursue medicine in the back of my mind . I majored in chemical engineering to give myself options , but I just recently decided within the last 12 months to 100 % pursue this career because it is something I really want to do . I have done a lot of thinking about more deeply why I want to be a physician and I am still working on that ."	I enjoy my chemical engineering courses . I think	Very well .	I like	"I like this professor because he is very organized , he explains things well , he structures the class well by giving ample time for in class problems to be worked , he seems to enjoy the material and teaching the material , he likes to use undergraduate TA's who are generally better at explaining things that the graduate TA's , his tests are fair , he covers the important concepts and he takes things seriously ."	I have only had 3 jobs but I would say my favorite was as a camp counselor at a tennis camp . I really enjoyed	I liked it because I knew the people there very well and it was fun working with kids of all ages to improve their skills . I enjoy tennis as well and the summer so it was so much fun . The other counselors were also very amazing	Mom	Because she has given me everything I could have ever asked for	I would buy her a new puppy .	Cam Aaron	"My friend is very similar to me . We enjoy many of the same things . We have the same Christian beliefs , we are both very conservative minded and talk a lot about politics , we are both athletic and play sports , we both work hard in school , we both would like to end up living back home in Huntsville and we share so many jokes ."	I think Cam is my best friend because we have the same beliefs and we love to do the same things .	"It depends on the team and if it is something I am interested in and the degree to which I can contribute . If the team's goal is to solve a problem that requires math and science or any sort of problem solving I will be the leader , but if it is something I am unfamiliar with i will not lead . Being a member of a team always does involve hard work and setting a good example ."	They would have a very strong work ethic and they would be as smart as I consider myself to be . I like to work with people who know what is going on rather than having to drag people along with me because you will get things done . I do not consider myself one to drag so I expect others not to drag me down .	I think they will say I like to get my work done but I also like to have a good time . I think they will say I am also smart and dedicated to my studies . They will also say I am very traditional and simplistic .	"I think when I was involved in an icebreaker game that involved a team to build a marshmallow tower , others would say that I was a good creative problem solver and I effectively communicated my ideas to the group ."	"I would say I tend to be a little quick to judge , I get a little mad sometimes when I am kept from sleeping , sometimes certain people and things frustrate me when I know they shouldnt really , I fight with my parents sometimes , I drink too much and I may be slightly cocky around my friends ."	"Sometimes the night before the test when I am trying to sleep , my roommate will come home and raise hell and will wake me up and I will go out there and yell at them . One time I threw a boot through the wall . Usually I can suppress my anger but sometimes I can't ."	"I believe I have a very high IQ , I am pretty athletic and coordinated , I am smart and I am a problem solver ."	I dont think it is really truly a big weakness . Maybe I think that it is alright to acknowledge that you are good at something during a survey . Obviously I am good at math and science which is why I am in chemical engineering . I dont think acknowledging a strength makes you not humble . I think it is naive of you to assume things .

I want to make a difference in the world . I am competitive but do my best to be empathetic and care for others .	"I don't have too much spare time because my schedule is usually full of activities , but I enjoy spending time with friends and feeling"	My favorite movie is The Count of Monte Cristo . My favorite TV show would probably be The Office or Prison Break .	"I love the Count of Monte Cristo because it has prison escapes , revenge , a plot that makes you think , and romance . The Office always makes me laugh and I love the romance as well . Prison Break is my other favorite show because it allows you to have empathy for criminals and it is captivating"	My all time favorite book is In Cold Blood by Truman Capote	"This is the book that inspired me to do what I want to do professionally . It was the first time I ever experienced empathy for a criminal and that amazed me . I found the story interesting , but the connection and history is captivating"	My teacher in 8th grade recommended it to me	"I want to live near a city . I am not exactly sure where , probably Washington D . C . As much as I think"	I would love to go downtown and experience the night life . I enjoy going to different stores and restaurants and always having somewhere to go . I would enjoy the history around me and the chance to make a difference because it is a place of power . I would enjoy the water nearby and do water sports as well	"I don't like to lie , party because it gives me anxiety and partly because I feel bad . But I sometimes lie if I have to in order to make someone feel better or to smooth over a situation . I don't think I'd lie just for the sake of it ."	"I don't think any of my habits are too bad . Sometimes I pick something out of my nose if it's bothering me and I don't have a tissue , and some of my eating habits aren't the best , but I wouldn't consider any of them awful"	I am passionate about justice . I want people who are looked down on to be represented and heard . I want to give a voice to those that society has forgotten . This mostly includes prisoners and refugees in my interests . I am also passionate about people in general .	"This passion started with some family difficulties in my childhood , but grew when I read In Cold Blood and wanted to understand criminals . I had a passion for crime at that point ( studying and solving crimes , not committing them ) and when I interned with a judge and learned about the judicial and jail systems , I had a passion to change the world by focusing on rehabilitation instead of retribution so that people can integrate into society . This then extended to refugees on a global scale ."	I am working towards attending law school . I have interned with a judge to get a judicial perspective of courtroom proceedings . I have taken classes in law and psychology . I have worked with teenagers struggling with drug abuse . And I try to educate myself on recurring and nuanced problems in these areas .	I want to attend law school and then eventually work for the FBI . I want to be a special agent and work up to becoming a criminal profiler if possible because I want to interview and assess the mentality of criminals . I also want to retire and do pro bono work for individuals who can't defend themselves and figure out how to work on prison reform .	I want to make a difference in the world . I want to advocate both for victims and criminals . I am interested in crime so I would find each day exciting and different . There is also decent pay and benefits upon retirement so I could then pursue other interests and spend time with my family .	"I am doing well in school and trying to make connections to achieve my goal . But as I take more classes and study new things my interests broaden , so I am open to wherever I am led and doing my best along the way ."	My favorite course that I have completed was Evidence and Legal Reasoning . My favorite course right now is Constitutional Law : Civil Rights .	I got an A and I learned a lot .	My favorite professor is Dr . Brown who teaches my Constitutional Law class	"I like him because he is extremely knowledgeable on the subject and shares his passion . He never makes a student feel insignificant or unintelligent , and he wants students to succeed . His classroom has become a safe place for discussions and debates . He expects a lot of his students but helps them get there ."	I was a peer counselor at a drug rehabilitation for teenagers .	I liked doing something that mattered . I liked seeing kids change and providing hope for them and their families . I loved how strong the bonds were that I formed with people there because we went through a lot together .	My mom	Probably some type of clothing and then help her pay off her car with the rest of the money .	My mom is one of the hardest workers I know and she provides for my brother and I . She is selfless and dedicated . She deserves something nice and some help as well .	I have a few . Lauren is my best friend here	She's adventurous . She wants to see the world and make a difference . She's friendly and sweet . She's a deep thinker and a great person to talk to . She loves everyone and doesn't judge people . She's fun to be around .	She is my best friend because I can tell her anything and we like to do everything together . We get along and think very similarly .	"I prefer to have a leadership role , but not to be the sole person in charge ."	"It depends on the kind of team . I would probably choose people who are hard-working , fun-loving , and kind ."	"Hard-working , caring , silly , friendly , understanding ."	My roommate and I talk about our days together and listen to each other . Just the other day she thanked me for always being there for her to talk to and have fun with .	"I am anxious , sometimes I think highly of myself , I can be intrusive and overbearing , and I overthink things"	I want to be included and sometimes that makes me too overbearing in other people's lives . I also overthink things that I say which hinders me . Just the other day I felt bad about forgetting to do something so I spent half an hour worrying about it .	I think I am unique because I try to look at many viewpoints and don't think anyone is ever completely wrong . I try to understand how people think and understand all sides .

I want to be in the medical profession , so that's why I love medical shows . And dramas and crime shows / movies just interest me for some reason ."	don't have an all time favorite book . I don't really read when I have spare time . Although I did enjoy	I just loved the romance and drama of it .	Well I went and watched the movie and i loved it so i said I'd read the book . It was also recommended to me by a teacher .	"I would live in either California , New York , or Italy . I'd live in New York because it's always busy like me . I'd want to live in California because of the laid back , chill vibe . I'd want to live in Italy because of the peace and beauty that their country side posses ."	"Well I love to shop , like that's literally all I do . I LOVE food , I eat all the time , and I love to try new foods too . I'm also a people person so I'd love to got to parties and chat and mingle with the locals . And the new things I'd try are maybe like acting classes in New York , horseback riding in Italy , and maybe taking a soul cycle class in California ."	OK so one time I told my mom and dad I was going to hang out with one of my girl friends . When in all actuality I was going to hang out with a guy I liked .	"I have a bad problem with gas , and my dad tells me about all the time when I belch at the table ."	"I'm passionate about kids , animals , my family , and food ."	I guess my passion of working with kids started when i started my babysitting business .	I'm majoring in nursing in pursuit of hopefully becoming a pediatric nurse . I watch kids on the weekend . I'm also minoring in child psychology .	I want to either be a pediatric nurse practitioner or a woman's health nurse practitioner .	"I love the contact with different people . For pediatrics I love to just be in an environment with children . And for woman's health , helping them bring new life into the world is just exciting ."	right now it's going alright . Some of the classes i'm taking are pretty difficult which worries me about if I'm going to be able to get into my major .	"I took a biomedical health ethics class , and I loved"	I did great . I got a 100 .	"I forgot what her name was , but the biomedical health professor has been my favorite ."	She was really relaxed . Like she was open about everything . She even cussed in the class which was humorous . But she was also passionate about her job and it came across to us . Something that I can say I haven ; t seen in the rest of my professors here .	Babysitting by far is my favorite .	"I love watching kids of all ages . There is never a dull moment . They keep you on your toes , and they keep you laughing ."	I'd spend it on my family .	"I'd buy my dad a pair of shoes and maybe a suit , because he's really tall and it's hard for him to find stuff . I'd probably buy my mom a pair of nice shoes and a purse ."	"I know how much my parents sacrifice for me , and those are the things they look for the most , so I know with those I wouldn't go wrong ."	"My best friends are Jillian , Tasha , Xavier , and my mom ."	"They are funny , they tell it to you like it is , and they're also a support system to hold you up whenever you are down ."	"We just click . They are like another brother / sister to me . I think we are best friends because we are opposites . Where one lacks in an area , the other compensates ."	I am definitely a follower who throws in their two cents every now and then .	"Someone who could push me because I know I get lazy . Someone who is good with their words , and doesn't just speak harshly . Someone who is compassionate to others ."	"I'm kind , look out for others , smart , funny , lovable , hug gable , approachable , sweet , diligent , perfectionist ."	In high school people always hugged me and were like you're so huggable . My mom always says I'm a perfectionist because I never finish anything until it's perfect .	"I'm a perfectionist , and that I let things affect me easily ."	"If someone says anything slightly negative towards me I can start to get upset , and maybe take what they said the wrong way ."	I rarely get angry . I am very fast at forgiving people . I have eminence dedication .	I always have trouble keeping my tasks for the week organized and getting them done in a timely manner .	cooking	Female	47.1819733	28.92591879	63.39599762	79.9020555	24.88615823	57.46366419	28.51804544	57.81030404	32.42217333	78.22681429	74.3690258	0.003920415	99.75644443	62.08344599	78.4824043	66.77300179	78.317755	79.25836919	83.39502463	69.06596435	94.08431085	65.20958921	40.13379072	93.4798883	84.4760451	58.63075401	71.32311527	43.21394183	85.15707792	77.51205089	80.03520314	94.32805221	78.60163994	93.05367803	87.4118433	27.98511723	83.7328422	97.31870567	0.00767576	93.7359203	99.17396669	11.93488551	73.03971713	92.02113099	11.58004946	49.00021603	40.75372436	79.9020555	57.46366419	79.25836919	83.39502463	94.08431085	93.4798883	84.4760451	58.63075401	71.32311527	37.31105315Jonathan Hall	"I am typically a relatively quiet individual who avoids confrontation . I generally sit back and watch others rather than involving myself in situations that don't involve me or that I don't want to be involved with .

"I I love spending a night at the school and just teaching until it is time for my class . Taekwondo allows me to escape from the pressures and difficulties of those pressures existing outside of taekwondo . It very much so is my escape .

For a movie , something like Percy Jackson or I Am Number Four ."	"I like the aspects of the combination of science fiction and fantasy . For whatever reason , I was never really a superhero kind of person , but I find the science-fiction / fantasy / mythology realm to be of much greater interest . It is fascinating to allow yourself to escape the natural confines that govern our physical world and wonder in the awe of someone else's made up fantasy ."	"Going back to the mythology and fantasy , my favorite book is Percy Jackson , or the Percy Jackson series of books ."	"Since I was young , I have taken and learned Latin to a certain extent , and have always been fascinated by mythology and ancient civilizations . The Percy Jackson books bring these ancient civilizations and mythology into the modern world without altering much of the original mythology . It is a way to experience the ancient stories in a modern , and more relatable , setting ."	"I discovered the book when I was forced to read it for a school project in middle school . Between then and now , I have read every book in that series and the subsequent series that were written after it ."	"If I could live anywhere in the world , I would live in a Shaolin temple in the forests of China ."	"Living in a Shaolin temple would allow me to study martial arts that has been passed down for centuries , and is some of the most authentic martial arts to this day . Shaolin temples also have an air of serenity and peace unlike any place that I can imagine , and I believe that for that to truly sink in and make sense you have to experience it firsthand ."	"I picked 3 because it is not that I have never lied before , and I don't want to lie in my response . I have told , and often don't see the issue in telling small white lies if for a good reason , but don't think that large and important issues should be lied about or hidden with lies ."	"I have some habits that are less than ideal , but almost exclusively effect me . These habits are more about issues that I need to overcome , such as swearing less frequently , but the manner in which the habit occurs does not negatively impact other individuals for the vast majority of the time ."	"I am passionate about my personal goals in taekwondo and in teaching the children not only the physical aspects of taekwondo , but also the mental aspects that go along with it ."	The passion started when I went to my first taekwondo class in the 3rd grade with my best friend at the time .	"Since the 3rd grade I have continued my passion , but was forced to take a break for several years . I have worked hard and have finally achieved my initial goal from when I was in the third grade of achieving my third degree black belt , but now my eyes are set higher .

"For the most part we all grew up together and spent the majority of high school together after separating for a bit and then gravitating back to one another .

"I love watching Crime related shows , I just love the suspense feeling of it . And as for the cooking shows , I want to be a cook when I get older , so anything with food fascinates me ."	Either Twilight or Fifty Shades of Grey .	"I love the plot behind Fifty Shades of Grey the most . And as for Twilight , it has always been an all time favorite of mine since I was younger ."	"I found Twilight because a friend told me about the movie and I love to read so I found the book as well and then read it . As for Fifty Shades of Grey , a lot of people were talking about it , so I found it online and read it and ended up enjoying it !"	If I could live anywhere in the world it would probably be England because the atmosphere over there just seems to always be energetic !	I love the accents of people over there for sure ! That would be a plus side to it !	"Depending on the situation , I sometimes lie to either get me out of trouble that i dont deserve or to help get someone else out of trouble ."	"I would say that biting my nails is a horrible habit when I am nervous or when I need to get the nail of quick . Also , I would say that one of my habits are when I feel like I can do my homework at night even though I know when I get home at night that I will be tired ."	Being a leader and cooking !	I had this passion for cooking for as long as I can remember . But it really started when I was in ninth grade and got the opportunity to be in a Culinary Class .	"I am majoring in the closest thing at my college , Hotel and Restaurant Management . And I also got a summer job at a four start resort / restaurant in Panama City Beach this summer !"	A chef or a pastry chef	Being around food all day or even being the person that makes peoples food and watching their reaction when they eat it and knowing that they will come back for the food that I have prepared !	I am doing really well I believe . I have many people in the industry that I am friends with and a lot of people where I go to school that can help me pursue my career goals .	When I take my HRMT ( Hotel and Restaurant ) courses for sure . If it is core classes then math would probably have to be my favorite .	I am doing pretty okay in the course right now !	"Probably my ENGL professor , Dr . Carter ."	"I had him for Comp 1 in the summer and I didn't like him at first , he is extremely mono toned and it was really hard to understand him and the way that he teaches . But by the end of the semester , I really enjoyed his class and the way he taught things because he was very helpful with everything that I asked . And now I requested him for comp 2 !"	My tiger catering job here at Auburn is pretty fun because of the people .	The people are very friendly and we get to interact with guest all the time1	"My boyfriend , James ."	A car . . . or at least a down payment for a car .	We have dated for a while now . And I know that he is trying to save up to get a car ! And I know this would really help him out !	"I have really grown apart from a lot of my best friends that I had while I was in high school \ . So , I would have to say my boyfriend , even though he is more than a best friend to me ."	"He is really considerate . And no matter how down I am about a test grade or family issues , he always seems to be there for me . Even though things may not go his way but it goes mine or vice versa , he always seems to be happy ."	"Well , he is my boyfriend . . And also because he makes my life better as a whole !"	"Well , if it was a team effort . I just like to stay to myself . But when it is a team effort I try to be a leader"	People who have the same skills as me . I really never have the intent on picking the best players to win . I usually pick people who I know I can have fun with !	"That I always have the right head on my shoulders , i am loud , and that I am fun to be around !"	"When I had to get an interview for the job in PCB , my old chef told them and even wrote an amazing letter of recommendation for me saying that I had all of these qualities and more !"	Sometimes I let people take advantage of me depending on the circumstances .	"Well , depending on the situation . If I know someone is wrong . . I would much rather just let them think I was wrong and they were right , over them getting upset or disliking me for something so silly !"	I always exceed on stuff that I have to do . And usually when I have to do them . I always am there for people when they need me . Even sometimes when I shouldnt be there .	My weakness for sure is what I said earlier .

I am 23 years old and married my high school sweetheart when i was 20 . I have a dog and a cat . I love to read and enjoy long walks and yoga ."	"I i love to read books , mostly romance novels , i love taking long walks while listening to relaxing music , and watching netflix . I mostly am spending time with my family and friends ."	My favorite T . V . show is Grey's Anatomy and CSI NY . But my favorite movie is tied between the Devil Wears Prada and the Cutting Edge	I love the drama / romance filled of it . It's just something you can watch like all day .	My all time favorite books are Beautiful Disaster and Redeeming Love	"Redeeming Love is my favorite because it teaches to always trust in God because with him nothing is impossible . Also , Beautiful Disaster is just a good romance ."	"Redeeming Love was recommended by a friend , and Beautiful Disaster I just happened to come across it in the library while looking for a book to read"	"I would love to live at the beach , any beach ! It's just so relaxing and beautiful . The personality is both filled with night life at night and during the day just a go with the flow kind of feel"	"I would love to go read a book at the beach and then go and eat delicious seafood . I would also love to go scuba diving and be able to see the under water world . I would also love to go deep sea fishing , it just sounds like so much fun ."	I don't like hurting people's feelings and sometimes the truth can hurt and I don't feel like the person needs to hear the truth right then . I always ending up telling them later but sometimes i rather wait until the right moment .	The only awful habit i have that is like what the question was asking is biting my nails and throwing my clothes on the ground after I wear them and letting it pile up then having to clean it all over again	"I am passionate about animals , standing up against child bullying , my religion , my education , and my marriage ."	"I have always grown up around animals and I love them . When I was in middle school I was bullied and once I entered high school I made new friends and it was great . But i just never want kids to experience bullying and the effect it has . I am also passionate about my religion because my relationship with God is very important to me , I became a Christian when I was 8 . Also I love my husband and we work hard at our marriage"	I rescued a dog and a cat from the humane society . I am also a psychology major and possibly consider counseling education as a masters . I want to help prevent bullying	I want to get a job and work for a year or two and then go to school part time and get a masters degree .	I love working with people . I can talk to almost anyone . So i really would love to have a job where I'm working one on one with people	I am doing good . My grades could be better but I am working on getting them better so that I can hopefully get into a good grad school . Also I am interning with the Marriage and Family Therapy program on campus to get a more variety in the Psychology field	I love	I am in it right now and i currently have an A	So far my favorite professor has been Dr . Katz	"He is just so laid back . The way he teaches is not towards a test . He actually explains everything in context and really makes sure you understand it . Also , the way he teaches is very entertaining . He makes it interesting and enjoyable , not boring"	I have now . I am a teacher's assistant at a preschool . I love	"I love working with the kids and playing , doing crafts , and spending time with them . They are always entertaining and it's never a dull moment"	I would probably spend it on my husband . He is so wonderful and I would want to do something nice for him	He loves to play xbox so I would probably buy him something to do with that or something related to star wars . He loves both of these	"I chose Will , my husband , because I love him . He is such a hard worker and I would want to give him something that he would be surprised by and just absolutely geek out over"	I would honestly say my husband Will	He is shy at first but when you get to know him he is hilarious . He can be serious most of the times but he can also be really funny . He is a hard worker and once his mind is made up about something then it is hard to change it . He is also very loyal and supportive	He is the love of my life . We share everything together and have been together so long . I just couldn't picture my life without him	I prefer to be the mediator . When things get off topic or gets in a bind then I like to bring it back to the orginal purpose	I would want someone who is a team player and who will put in the same amount of hard work I would .	They would probably say that I am a people person . I can talk to just about anyone . I make friends easily and that I love to have fun	My mother-in-law and I went shopping one time and I started talking to the cashier . We ended up talking for about 15 minutes and when we got to the car my mother-in-law was like : you never meet a stranger do you ? As in by the time I get done talking with the person I end up knowing them	Probably that I get stressed easily \	I am not very open about this but I was diagnosed with an Anxiety disorder last year and it can easily make me act certain ways . So sometimes I get anxious and can appear to be stress or irritattion	"That I can carry on a conversation with anyone , also that I can make people feel good / make their day better"	Stressing easily and it effecting my daily experiences	I would probably win a talk show that way I could talk for a living to people and get paid for it	Female	45.59906578	13.58675459	62.87789147	99.92058441	24.21204084	40.46882564	32.52829776	66.64440289	28.69636068	81.05764161	60.30385528	29.81115587	99.99941266	99.99799126	69.763117	67.02779522	67.15040254	81.37318875	79.21021213	29.34935513	94.46774823	75.63219637	70.48210005	84.42015861	90.88662884	37.30919179	73.10951491	97.58558401	87.90128782	95.86348151	89.88235161	79.09288275	75.66906048	94.12200522	92.77794535	97.51236781	99.00063369	99.98798175	40.53898002	99.34645217	99.93309609	85.67774459	99.86703267	86.5133669	17.97404445	65.36256286	24.86094903	99.92058441	40.46882564	81.37318875	79.21021213	94.46774823	84.42015861	90.88662884	37.30919179	73.10951491	18.61773349Kirsta Channell	"I'm not entirely sure . One aspect of my personality is that I constantly question myself , so I find it difficult to say with certainty . I can tell you that I'm very disorganized , but I usually end up making things work . I'm considered incredibly odd , but I identify myself in being different ."	"I would love to sing in a jazz band , or organize arrangements for a choir ."	I really liked	"I think it's really interesting . On one hand , you get to use the very psychological techniques they talk about to try and figure out who the killer is or what he or she is like before they show you , and it's also just an aspect of life I've never dealt with ."	"I haven't read many books , honestly . I really liked"	"I liked it because I have good memories associated with it , as well ."	"It was the favorite book of a very close friend . I bought it and read it so I could figure out what it was that he liked about it , and in a sense get to know him ."	I think	I would enjoy learning about a new culture as well . I would like to go to school in a new place .	"I rarely purposefully tell lies , but I lied all the time of a child , so it's a habit I'm trying to break . Mostly I exaggerate a lot when I'm telling stories ."	"I picked it because I leave room for error in my answers . I do not remember what the question was , so I'm going to keep typing and hope you don't notice ."	"Hmm . . . I'm passionate about learning new things . Not necessarily in an academic sense , but I enjoy it when I learn things about people's thoughts or how their minds work . I enjoy it when conversation yields new knowledge . I enjoy it when I pick up a new instrument or learn a new song ."	"Well , I think it's kind of genetic ."	"I try to always fill my time . I sleep when I'm tired , but if I'm awake I try my hardest to be productive in some way . Usually I'm not productive in the way I should be , but I try to learn something new everyday . I also like analyzing myself and others , so that works ."	I want to be a pharmacist after I graduate . I also want to pursue my hobbies more and teach others things that make me happy .	"Well I've always enjoyed monotonous calculations in math , which are exactly the type of calculations used in the measurement of drugs . My favorite aspect of it is that I'll get to learn all sides of how drugs work : I get to learn what the drugs are , what they treat , how they work , how to use them , and how they interact with eachother ! It just sounds like really cool science ."	"I'm very anxious . Because I have picked a job that is fairly monotonous , strenuous in hours , and takes years of school , I often wonder if it's the right decision . It's very scary to think that most of my friends will already have a kid when I graduate . However , after participating in my first college leveled biology and chemistry courses , I am confident that I haven't chosen the wrong thing , necessarily ."	"Right now my favorite course is Biology . In high school my favorite course was Chemistry . However , my Chemistry course right now is practically still going over unit converters , which is very basic , while my Biology course is doing an intro to Organnic Chemistry , so we'll see !"

"I would spend it on the first person who has a need for money . Right now I would spend it on my friend Sonia , because she's raising money to attend a discipleship program ."	I would pay her way through her discipleship program .	"Because I love her deeply , and I believe in my heart that her infectious joy will one day change the world .

He's kind of lame and he annoys me often , but he's good for me . He's incredibly rational and supportive , and thus he regulates my dange rous mood swings ."	"Because I can be honest with him . He's not the person I have the most in common with , or the person that is the most fun to be around , but he allows me to unapologetic ally be myself , and he doesn't give me anxiety ."

John always talks about how he enjoys that I don't talk bad about others and I try not to get into drama .	I'm messy and disorganized . I have hysterical mood swings . Sometimes I can be too honest and sound like a blunt jerk . Sometimes I treat the people I really love and people who I'm indifferent about in the same way .	"Well my home is very messy , and everyone points that out . Also my friends sometimes get their feelings hurt when coming to me with a problem , because I don't always take their side unless I truly think they're right ."	I think that I'm good at solving problems in a unique way . I believe that I can easily see alot of different views on things and share them with others .

So i refused to be like them and they have always pushed me to do better then what they did .	I went to community college first . After that i went into the military to help pay for school then i transferred to auburn . I always try my best to make good grades . I feel like good grades will take you far and also means you understand the concept well enough . I always associate bad grades with not knowing the material well enough . Even in high school i strive for good grades event though i could have done better .

I would spend it on my Parents and my brother .	My brother could use a lot of new clothes and so could my mom and dad . I would also give them the rest of the money to pay for some bills . That would be very helpful to them .	Because they have done so much for me and i can never repay them .

"I've heard that I am pretentious , overbearing and a little cold ."	I was told that I was pretentious when I moved to a small town in Alabama from Germany and the other girl was jealous . Overbearing when I try to schedule things so groups that I am in don't get behind ( even when they don't try to set anything up and are apathetic . ) And that I am a little cold because I don't always speak first in social settings .	I am also smart and funny but those are not necessarily unique to myself .	"My biggest weakness is my emotions . When I get upset , it colors my perception of a situation ."	I would play piano .

Like in the idea of kids believing in Santa , you don't want to lie to them but it's all part of the fun . Or if you really don't want to hurt someone's feelings , a white lie can never truly hurt . I hate lying and liars , but sometimes it's necessary ."	I really do have some terrible habits . I bite my fingernails like no other and it drives others and myself sometimes crazy . I also have some sticky fingers and I'll steal things from stores or my friends just for the fun and the sudden rush of it all .	"I'm passionate about becoming a special education teacher and making a different in my students' lives . I've always wanted to work with kids with intellectual and physical disabilities and the closer I get to reaching my goal , the more dedicated and passionate I am about changing their lives and working to end the stigma around those with special needs ."	"It started when I was in elementary school and I would give up my recess times to play with the children in the special education classrooms and it only grew as I got older and began volunteering and working the Special Olympics . My aunt also has an intellectual disability and I love spending time with her because nothing bad is ever going through her mind , she's always so happy to see me and spend even a minute together ."	I'm in school right now to become a special ed teacher . I also completed my pre-teaching in December and spent five days in a special ed classroom in an elementary school shadowing the teacher and working with her students .	A special education teacher in an elementary school .	"Definitely not the salary . I think what's most attractive to me is the reward of feeling a connection with the child and knowing that school can be a place for them to be themselves and learn , because that's all everyone really wants in life ."	I'm doing well . I've started looking at Masters programs so I would have the option to move out of a classroom setting if I wanted and work elsewhere with people with special needs .	My psychology courses have by far been my favorite courses . Developmental psychology was extremely interesting and abnormal psychology is very interesting as well /	I finished with an A .	Dr . Daniels is my favorite professor	Dr . Daniels is a great lecturer . She knows exactly how to engage her students in a classroom of 200 and moves at just the right pace to make sure she doesn't lose anyone . She is also incredibly helpful when help is needed and offers a lot of time to her students .	Working as a research and project coordinator	I liked it because it was brand new information . It was for a pharmaceutical company so everything from the programs to the doctors to the drug information were all new to me . I learned a great deal of things . The pay was also great .	My sister	"I would buy her whatever she needed at the time . I'd probably donate the $ 1 , 000 to helping her pay rent on an apartment somewhere or to helping her buy a new car ."	"Because she's my sister and my best friend . She's given me so much over my 20 years of life and I feel like no matter what I do for her , I'll never be able to pay her back . She wants to move out of my house back home so badly but struggles with the costs of rent . She's just my best friend and I would do anything for her ."	My best friend is my boyfriend Cody .	"Cody is just the most amazing person I've ever met . He's so funny and no matter what my mood is , he puts a smile on my face and makes me laugh . He's considerate and passionate about what he loves and wants to change the world someday . His dreams are so big but he's so determined to do whatever it takes to achieve them ."	He makes me laugh . That's the most important part . But he also makes me feel like I'm worth something to the world and the universe wouldn't be the same without me . He helps me see the silver linings in life and I'm so grateful for him .	"I prefer to not be the leader , but a close second to that ."	They would be hardworking and dedicated to the job . They would be cooperative and considerate of everyone's thoughts and opinions . Respect would also be a big key component of their personalities .	I would hope they would say I'm passionate and supportive . That I love in everywhere I can and try to spend my days helping others and making others happy .	"When I was pre-teaching , I went and bought little gifts for my students and was up really late wrapping them and writing them little notes thanking them for welcoming me so warmly , even though I know most of the kids couldn't read . I cried when they opened them and the looks on their faces were my favorite part of the entire experience ."	"I would probably have to say my worst quality is that I'm very stubborn . If I get into an argument , I hate to lose . I'm not competitive , I just hate when people rub in my face that they won and I lost ."	"When Cody and I argue , he always tries to one up me with a counter argument and wants to win every fight , even when he knows he's wrong ."	I believe that I'm unique in the way that I treat every person with respect and love .	Just every day things . I get anxious about almost anything and everything .	Training dogs .

I enjoy being outside , hanging with friends , and watching movies and TV . I'm also extremely determined in regards to my school work ."	"I enjoy being outside , hanging with friends , and watching movies and TV . I also like spending time with my family ."	"My favorite TV show is Breaking Bad because it is well-produced , well-written , well-acted , and offers an incredibly deep character study ."	I think I enjoy the plot the most because it is a genuinely unique concept that I hadn't really seen before I watched it .	My favorite book is probably THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO because it has such an interesting story .	The book is really interesting because there is a huge twist at the end . and the massive passage of time between the crime and the detective work makes it especially difficult for the detectives to figure it all out .	"I discovered the book because the movie was about to come in theaters , and I wanted to read it before I saw the movie ."	"I'd probably want to live in Switzerland because it has a very picturesque landscape , and I've never been to Europe . The personality of the place is rich in history and natural beauty ."	"I would probably sight see , try new cuisine , and meet new people . And since Switzerland is located just about in the center of Europe , I could easily explore other countries nearby ."	I rarely ever lie . I'm a pretty forthright person . I think it is mean and deceptive to lie .	"I don't really have any bad habits . I sometimes chew my fingernails , but that's about it ."	"I'm passionate about my family and friends . I'm passionate about reaching my goals in life , which means going to medical school and becoming a doctor . I'm passionate about my political beliefs as well ."	"This passion started from my mom being a nurse . She really sparked my interest in the medical field , and it has been my goal to reach it for the longest time ."	I've been doing my best to maintain a 4 . 0 throughout my college career and volunteering .	I want to go to medical school after I graduate and become a doctor .	The aspects I find interesting about going into the medical field is that I will be able to help people on a daily basis and my job will challenge me daily so it will never become stale to me .	"I'm doing pretty well . As of right now , I have a 4 . 0 GPA and plan to continue volunteering this semester as I did last semester ."	My favorite course in college is probably chemistry .	I made an A last semester and have an A right now this semester .	My favorite professor right now is probably Professor Cagg .	"I like Professor Cagg because he is really thorough in the way he teaches which makes it much easier to understand , he's not afraid to explain something a different way to help you understand , and he has a good personality ."	My favorite job was when I worked as a vitals technician for Clearview Cancer Institute .	"I enjoyed it because I got to get experience in a field I plan on entering in the future , and I got the opportunity to get hands-on experience with patients . This allowed me to better understand what patients are going through and gave me the opportunity to try and brighten their days a little ."	"I would probably spend the money on my parents because they raised me , made sure I was always provided for , love me unconditionally , are paying for my college , and have always driven me to do well in life ."	I'd probably spend on some kind of experience for them to enjoy like traveling to a new place or something like that .	"I chose my parents because they raised me , made sure I was always provided for , love me unconditionally , are paying for my college , and have always driven me to do well in life . And I chose that purchase because my parents tend to not like just more stuff as gifts ."	My best friend is probably Trent Conquest .	"My best friend is a fun , honest person . He is fun to be around , and we enjoy hanging out . Trent's personality is random and funny . He always finds something new that he knows I'll find funny ."	He's my best friend because I get along with him better than I get along with anybody else . He's is one of the few people I can be more or less completely truthful with .	I tend to not be the actual leader in a group but tend to be the hand the softly guides everyone along . I tend to figure out the more difficult problems which puts me in that situation .	Ideal teammates would be people who are about the same intelligence as I am . They can take initiative and do things without being told to . And we all have being on a team together .	"They'll most likely mention intelligence , prudence , and sense of humor ."	"My mom always mentions how I'm the smartest of her three boys , and how she' My mom always mentions how I'm the smartest of her three boys , and how she's glad I don't require as much help as the others ."	"By people that don't really know me very well and based on a really weird string of events , they said I was lazy which really runs contrary to the truth . They thought since I was busy with school work I was simply trying to skip out on other work ."	They said this about me because they didn't really know me and didn't believe me when I was doing homework and not the work they wanted me to be doing .	I believe that I have a very technically critical mind which I think most people don't have .	"I think my biggest weakness is part of one of my biggest strengths . I think sometimes I over analyze social situation , and it freaks me out more than it should ."	I would probably draw a portrait for the talent show .

Throughout the book you see him grow intellectually , and then at the end he stops the process and goes back to how he was talking in the beginning ."	It was a summer reading project for high school my freshman year . I usually don't like to read but I enjoyed reading it .	I would love to live in Georgia because it is just like where I am from but more to do . It is in the South and there is a great energy vibe . As well as there is an NFL team there that I could work with . Anywhere in the south would be fine with me .	"I would enjoy drinking a nice ice cold sweet tea , where it isn't to hot or to cold . As well as having a nice southern meal that night for dinner . While shopping during the day ."	I do lie because sometimes I don't like to hurt other peoples' feelings . Or I don't want to face the consequences	I don't really notice my habits . I have a lot of good habits but there are some bad ones .	I am passionate about my family the most . As well as my school work and the things I enjoy the most . I am also passionate about people not discriminating against others .	This passion started when I was younger and I as I got older it started to grow . I never liked when people were not treated the same just because of the way they look . Everyone deserves an opportunity no matter their look .	I have done research on it and I have spoken my opinion on it as well . I spend time with the people I love and I dig deep into my passion .	After college I want to join the Navy so that I can work with the Blue Angels and be their athletic trainer . Then later on be able to work with an SEC college football team as their athletic trainer .	I like to help other people and want to make them better . I have been around athletes my whole life and just love it . I am attracted to sports medicine because of the intensity .	I am on the right track I am getting my basics done . I have to find a graduate school because I will need my certification for my degree . I am researching my goal as well to stay informed .	My favorite course in college would have to be my Kinesiology class that I took last semester . We learned so many different things that can effect the body . As well as what we should do to help our body .	I did very well in that course . I came out with a high B because we only had two test in the class .	My favorite professor in college would have to be my English professor last semester . He was so energetic at 8 : 30 in the morning . He got to know everyone in the class individually and wanted to know our concerns .	He was energetic and fun at such an early time in the morning . He related to us on a level that no other professor has because he was so close in age with us . As well as he was a great teacher .	My favorite job would have to be my most recent job . That was Oral Arts .	I like it because time would go by fast . The pay was really good . I worked with some hardworking people and I enjoyed it .	I would spend it on my mother . She is the first person who deserves the world and more .	"I would buy her all the cookbooks she wanted , and all the splenda packets I could . As well as a nice king size bed for her ."	"My mother is my number one fan and always has my back . I picked the purchase because she loves cooking and loves to have her drink . As well as she loves her sleep , and happy momma happy life ."	My best friend would have to be Brittany .	My best friend is crazy and there is never a dull moment when we are together . She is a very driven person when it comes to money . Although she isn't in school she still likes to have her time occupied . She is very talented and smart she just doesn't always use it . We are opposite though but in some ways we are very much alike .	She is my best friend because she cares about me . She has a genuine heart and helps me in life . As well as she keeps me laughing in life and I can tell her anything .	I prefer to play any kind of role on the team . I have been known to take the lead because I like to get things done .	My ideal teammates would be people who were driven and hard working . I want people with high standards for themselves and don't like to disappoint . As well as people who are okay with making mistakes in life . I want people who share ideas and are open to others ideas	They will say I am a very organized person . I like to accomplish my task in a timely manner . As well as I am always striving for the best .	One time there was a situation where I had to organize these files in an office . I was done with my work and it was so much easier to find things . I was greatly appreciated and I was happy myself	I can be portrayed as rude and not easy to talk to . The worst qualities about myself are that I don't always think before I speak my mind . I have been known to just say things that are very rude . I don't care about how people feel at times .	I once hurt someones feelings because I spoke what was on my mind . I didn't care for that persons feelings . Once people said something that's when I look at what I said and try to apologize .	Some unique qualities I have are being passionate about what I am doing . As well as not caring what other people think to hold me back .	I just said aloud to the person that they didn't look good even though they felt they did . I hurt their feelings and didn't really care .	My greatest talent would have to be singing if I had to pick one . Especially while acting .

"I spend my free time volunteering at my church , doing homework , and exercising ."	My favorite TV show is The Office and my favorite movie is The Insanity of God .	I enjoy The Office because it makes me laugh no matter how many times I watch it . I love The Insanity of God because it is a great story of the global missions effort and how the Lord provides for those who live in oppressed countries .	"Other than the Bible , my favorite book is Counter Culture by David Platt ."	It lists out several topics that show how the world lives contrarily to what the Bible teaches and gives reasonable ways that Christians can live differently than that .	My high school youth pastor led a study through it a few years ago .	"I would live in Tennessee because it is far enough away from where I grew up , but still close enough for me to frequently see my family . The personality is a conservative-minded majority with a focus on the beauty of the outdoors ."	"I've always enjoyed exploring outside ever since I was old enough to do it , so to go out and explore God's creation that has been so wonderfully preserved through the years sounds incredible to me ."	"I try to be honest all the time because the Bible says not to lie on many occasions . However , I am not perfect so it would be dishonest to say that I never lie ."	"I often tend to procrastinate when I begin to do an assignment , which is not a good habit to have , especially when you have a good bit of work to do . Also I usually go to bed far too late to get enough sleep ."	"I am passionate about taking the gospel of Jesus Christ to the nations . Also , being a pharmacy major I am passionate about the advancement of medicines in order to treat people who have various ailments ."	"My passion for reaching the nations started about a year ago when I first came to Lakeview Baptist Church here in Auburn where I was taught the value of global missions . My passion for medical advancement came when my best friend's father was diagnosed with Parkinson's , for which there is no known cure and most of the effective treatments are illegal in most of the US ."	I am patiently waiting for the opportunity to go on some international mission trips in pursuit of reaching the nations with Christ . I am currently studying to become a pharmacist one day to research new drug treatments for various illnesses .	I want to be a research pharmacist after I graduate .	The ability to discover new treatments and finally help people who haven't been able to receive medical attention for something that afflicts them is attractive to me .

They have already been through so much at such a young age so if I can do anything to lighten their load , I'm always happy to do it ."	I would probably spend it on my girlfriend .	I would put it towards paying for her to go back to a place she loves on a mission trip .	Because I love her and it would make her happy to be able to go back for another trip to a place she loves .	My best friend is my girlfriend .	She loves the Lord and she loves to laugh . She is an overall joyful person who is motivated towards her goals and organized in all that she does .	Because we know each other very well and love spending time together and having fun .	I prefer to be a leader on a team .	"My ideal teammates would be people who are dedicated to achieving the task at hand in an efficient way , but also have a good time in the process . They are honest and trustworthy , but most importantly hard working ."	"I care about other people , and often put their needs in front of my own . Also that I love to make other people laugh and feel welcomed ."	My girlfriend gave me a hand-written letter for our anniversary in which she told me what she likes most about me .	"I sometimes can be what they call "" brutally honest "" meaning I will tell them the truth even if it hurts them . They may also say that I talk too much ."	"On several occasions , a friend of mine has been in a tough situation in which he was at fault . When he asked me if he was truly to blame , I had to honestly tell him that he was , which was hard for him to hear ."	I have a talent for retaining information better than most people . I also am musically inclined and learning new songs come easier to me than it does to most people .	I sometimes get carried away in trying to make other's laugh or feel comfortable that I end up feeling like that person thinks I'm annoying .	I don't believe that I can do something to beat someone else in a competition for $ 1 million .

I like to have me time . I'm a pretty relaxed person .	Depends on what kind of day I've had usually . I spend it either hanging out with friends or laying in bed watching TV	I really like	I tend to loose myself in criminal dramas like Law in Order and i like to try and figure out the case along side them . I like stand up comedy because it helps me forget about everything going on and have a good laugh .	I really don't read books that often . Its hard for me to recall .	My favorite type of book would be a mystery or romance because those are the types of stories I like to loose myself into .	Usually recommended .	I think	I've grown up is south Alabama and even if i were to move out of the state I'd like to stay south and by water . Having lived on the water my whole life I enjoy being able to just look out and feel like its an escape .	"I don't like to lie to people it gives me a bad feeling in my stomach , but if i have to I'm willing to protect someone or hide something if it is in their best interest ."	"I don't think I have an awful habit , unless you consider biting your nails a awful habit ."	I really enjoy pottery and helping others	in high school I took a ceramic class and fell in love	"I took several move classes in high school and even did a few projects and home , but I have not found a way to continue in college"	"I'd like to first be and RN ( nurse ) , but later I really hope to come back to school to be a teacher for future nurses ."	"Like I mentioned before I like to help people and weather that be their health or in learning . I have several family members that are nurses , and the change in day to day pace really attracted me as well ."	"I feel I'm doing pretty well . This semester I am having a little more trouble than last , but I think I will adjust better to each professors teaching and testing styles ."	That's a hard one . I know with my major it should be a science but since I really haven't gotten into major specific classes I'd have to say my favorite class was Anthropology .	I did very well . I think I finished with a high A .	Dr Beard .	He was really interesting in getting to know each of his students and made his classroom a comfortable environment to learn and share ideas and opinions .	Probably when I was a nanny for a 3 year old girl .	She was the sweetest and so mature it was always really fun .	Easy my mom .	She is always shopping for my sister and I and never takes the time to get anything for herself even when I try my hardest to pick something for herself . I would also just like to show her how much I appreciate her .	Because she deserves it and I'd redo her wardrobe because she is always feeling self conscious about her clothes I always let her barrow mine but I feel shed love to have her own .	My friend Gigi Kingsmill	She really out going and loud and slightly inappropriate . She can joke around or have a very serious sit down conversation . And she is very relaxed .	We really understand each other .	I'm never just hang around in the back ground of a group . Even if I am not the leader in a group I like to be fully engaged and speak out .	"Calm , Hard working , thoughtful . Calm because it never works when one person is just freaking out the whole time . Hard working so it is fair and everyone does their part . Thoughtful because it is important to not offend any partners because that will not help the team as a whole ."	I think I have left with others that I am caring .	"I'm always willing to help a friend out , listen and comfort and help them overcome whatever it is they need"	I'm very messy .	I'm a mess I try to get organized and I like organization but I always find myself making a huge mess on my desk or in my room .

We both love superheroes , sports , band , all around having fun ."	I prefer to be either a follower or second-in-command . I will accept a leadership role if necessary .

I know they wouldn't fail me if I invited them to a project ."	They would probably say that I am kind and caring . I try to be a good listener as well .	"Before a youth event at my church , my youth pastor came in and talked to the college leaders about why we were chosen ; he told us we were exactly what he wanted those kids to be when they grow up , that's why he contacted and chose us .

I have no specific example .	I have an undying care and love for others . I always like to help others in need .	"I never really had a leadership position during my high school years except for being a section leader , and that was only over 3 other people ."	I could compete in general comic book / comic move knowledge .

He can be a bit lazy when it comes to standing up for himself or addressing an issue , but he always gets the job done ."	"His personality really clicks with mine , and I know that he is always there for me when I need him ."	I like to be a leader or informal leader .	"I would choose people that are compitent and thoughtful . They shouldn't blindly do everything I ask , but they should be thoughtful enough to trust in my judgement or make the right choices for themselves ."	I think they would say that I am thoughtful and am a caring person .	"I always think through things and try to do everything I can for the people around me and those I care about . I am quick to give advice and emotional support , and I will always give my time when I feel that I have it ."	I am very judgmental .	"I am constantly judging people and expecting them to do the right thing . When they don't , I don't see why and get very upset with them ."	I always try to do the right thing . I give 100 % in everything I do . I whistle and sing constantly . I have very unique quirks about myself .	I often get upset with people when they make the wrong decisions or don't do the best that they can .	My greatest talent would probably be whistling .

I am usually pretty sensitive and emotional , but can be strong and resilient if need be . I like to think I am intelligent and pleasant to be around ."	"I I I enjoy working out , painting , singing , playing with my cat , reading , and spending time with my friends ."	I love	New Girl has many characters that I can relate to and they make me laugh . Whenever I am feeling down I watch that show and it improves my mood .	I absolutely love	They are both beautifully written and entertaining and contain life lessons that I can apply to my own life . They are both really long and I love long books because I read really fast and I can get something new from them every time .	My friend recommended The Other Boleyn Girl and my mom lent me Redeeming Love .	"I have visited so far , I believe I would like to live in Gatlinburg , Tennessee because there are so many things to do and it is surrounded by nature ."	I like to do any type of outdoor activity . I love horseback riding or more extreme things like snow skiing or even sky diving . I love to rock climb and hike and kayak and all sorts of things like that .	Sometimes I think that white lies can save a lot of grief and heartache when the lie told will not harm the person in any way or come back to negatively effect them . It is always morally right to tell the truth but I admit I lie sometimes when it is prudent for me or someone else .	"I actually just forgot what you just asked me , I answered honestly and then just blanked out . Oops"	I am passionate about the people in my life that I care about . My friends and loved ones . I am passionate about music and art and dance and self expression and accepting one another as we are . I am passionate about my faith in God and the way this causes me to live my life . I am passionate about making a difference in the world and preserving the earth .	I have always had a soft heart and a gentle nature and I think these things are important to me because of that . I feel things very deeply and because of that I have great empathy for others and strive to treat everyone with respect .	I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Exercise Science and will be pursuing my doctorate in physical therapy next year so that I can dedicate my career to improving the lives of others .	I want to be a physical therapist and work with people who need rehabilitation to be able to continue living a normal life .	I like the fact that each day will be something different and that I will have the opportunity to touch many people's lives . I think that this will be a rewarding career .	I have been accepted to one Physical Therapy school so far and I am waiting to hear back from three others .	My favorite course in college has to be either my Intro to Ethics class my freshman year or my Anatomy and Physiology I course .	I made high A's in both of them .	"My favorite professor was either my literature professor my junior year , Brian Valentyn , or my ethics professor Dr . Lockhart ."	"They really seemed interested in how I was doing with their classwork as well as outside of class . I could tell they are passionate about their subject and did what they could to help us succeed . They were both very understanding about the fact that college students have other things going on besides just class , and they were receptive and understanding to that ."	My favorite job I have had so far isn't very grand or high scale . I worked at a diner style restaurant throughout high school and made tons of friends that I still have to this day . It was a fun and exciting environment to work in and I was never bored .	It was a fun atmosphere and I made good friends and good money .	I would spend the money on my parents and helping them out with the costs of day to day living .	I wouldn't buy them anything I would just give them the money to use as they saw best fit . .	My parents have always done everything they can to make my life as comfortable as possible and they deserve that appreciation and gesture of thanksgiving .	This one is hard . My best friend that I have known since I was in 6th grade would have to be my number one . She lives in California now so it is hard to see her but our bond will always be there . I have a now ex boyfriend who is still my friend now who I would also consider a best friend but in a different way .	My best friend from California is a total free spirit . She is artistic and creative and outspoken and she doesn't let people bring her down or change who she is . She is intensely loyal and the most hilarious person I know .	She is my best friend because I click with her more than I do with anyone else . Even after a year of not seeing each other when we meet back up its like no time has passed . She just gets me and I get her and we have endless fun together .	"I enjoy being a team leader . I am somewhat of a perfectionist and like things to be done a certain way . However , I don't mind sharing power with others because I can also be indecisive at times and its nice to get feedback ."	My teammates would be intelligent and hard working and willing to compromise and make decisions best for the team rather than steamroll and insist that they are right . I would like diversity among my team to introduce many different perspectives and ideas into the group dynamic .	I think my friends would say that I am empathetic and able to relate well to others . I am able to give advice and listen to your problems without placing judgement . I want to see my friends happy and try to uplift them as much as possible and I think they would agree with that .	Anytime me and my friends are all together they will ask me relationship advice or advice on how to interact with others in a comfortable way . I think they trust me to help them navigate through the sometimes tumultuous social waters .	My number one weakness most people would point out is my temper and my sensitivity . I let things rub me the wrong way and don't stop to rationalize that they may not mean it in the way I initially perceive it . I take things to heart and react before I give myself a chance to think the situation through and reevaluate with a calm mind .	I got into a verbal argument with one of my roommates because she used my football tickets without asking to pay for them ( so I thought ) but really I had just forgotten that she had asked so I got mad and caused and issue for no reason	I believe that I am able to personally relate to people on a deep level just by learning a few things about them . I feel I have a gift of making people feel comfortable to open up to me and trust the advice that I give them .	I think my biggest weakness is self doubt and my tendency to overthink and worry to the point where I can't think of anything else .	I believe that I would use my talent of singing .

Action / crime / syfi shows usually have some interesting scientific point to it and then they keep you on the edge of you seat ."	I'd have to say The Host	"I think its because it was the first book i read that introduced my to the syfi world . The I'm not a fan of straight up romance novel because i get second-hand embarassment from them , but The Host has romance and pseudoscience in it which holds my attention more"	"The Host was recomended to by my best friend in high school . she gave me a copy of her book and we would write our thoughts and feelings on passages in the margens . and then when we passed it back-and-forth , we would comment on each other's comments"	"I'd like to live in Sydney Australia , and it's personality , to me , would be laid back , but doing lots of different things"	"i'd be enjoying the vibe the city gives and the activites that are most prevelent there ( ie . swimming at the beach , hiking in a mountainous area )"	"Sometimes I tell lies of obmission to prevent my mom from worrying , so sometimes I wont tell her i'm going out or if i'm already doing something she dislikes I just wont tell her i've done it .

I use swear words like adjadives basiclly which i'm constantly told by my parents is how a lady should speak . i'm leaving things lying around the house until I absolutely have to move it , like notes , textbooks and clean laundry"	"I guess the environment and maintaining it , not being perpetually in debt / saving , and then issues concerning sexual assault and birth control / abortion"	"I really like nature and I always have , so i decided that this is something i wan to be able to show my kids and my grandkids .

"well my career is in Ecological engineering so that is how I plan to insure that our environment is conserved for current needs and the needs of our future generations .

I consider myself to be studious , and I pride myself on my integrity of character . I am a loyal friend- perhaps to a fault- and I enjoy one on one time with my friends . It is my goal in life to help as many people as I can possibly reach ."	"I enjoy to sit quietly . Sometimes it is necessary to spend time by myself . If I am with my friends , however , I enjoy playing video games or board games with them , solving puzzles , or simply talking and enjoying each other ."	"don't have a favorite movie , but I tend to like"	"I like The Office because of its satirical , sarcastic type of humor . At the same time , the characters undergo a significant character development , and they are all dynamic and comparable to the real-world kind of person . It looks at everyday life ."	"If I had to pick one , I would say Ender's Game ."	"My dad gave me that book when I was considering a career in the military . He had to read it when he was going through Officer Candidate School , and he wanted to pass it on to me . At first , I enjoyed it because it was something my dad and I shared . But as I continued to reread the book , I could identify myself in the characters and see specific events that held significants in my own actions ."	My dad gave me the book .	"I would want to live at the base of a mountain , right next to a lake . The personality of this place is calm . If this place was a person , it would enjoy yoga and sunsets and sailboats ."	"I would enjoy watching the boats go across the water , and perhaps sailing one myself . I would also enjoy swimming , hiking among the mountain trails , smelling the trees , and listening to the peaceful noise of nature ."	"I consider myself an honest person , even when the outcome could harm me . For instance , my peers were being untruthful and seriously undermining the values of the organization we were representing . I did something about it at the risk of losing my friends . However , if someone I loved was in danger and my lie would aid them , I would lie without a second's hesitance ."	""" Awful habits "" is relative . I don't do anything I consider to be immoral , but I do bite my nails . Especially for personal hygiene , that's pretty awful ."	I am passionate about my community and improving the lives of others . I am also passionate about the sciences .	"My parents raised me to be sympathetic to my neighbor and connected to my community . At the same time , I also saw my sister very sick and in the hospital , my dad deployed , and my mom in a distressed state . As a young girl , I wanted to help bring comfort to my family as best I could . As I have grown up , the desire to bring comfort has spread to everyone I can reach . I like the sciences simply because I have been introduced to them . My dad is a biology major , and we often discussed life ."	"I have started my course of study to become a doctor . My major is biology , with a pre-med focus . I am also part of AED , which is a volunteer organization . I have also applied to be a Resident Assistant for the upcoming school year ."	I want to be a doctor of Osteopathic medicine .	"I like the profession of the doctor because they take an oath to "" do no harm . "" I want to be able to bring comfort to people and improve their lives . Specifically , I like the Osteopathic practice because it is holistic , meaning they look at and treat the mind and body as a whole , rather than treating individual ailments and symptoms ."	"I am doing very well , thank you ! Sometimes class gets stressful , but I enjoy my studies , and I have made all A's in my first semester . I enjoy what I'm doing ."	"So far , my favorite class has- to my surprise- been Biomedical Ethics ."	"I did very well . I earned a 100 , and I currently maintain communication with my professor ."	"So far , my favorite professor is Greg Harris ."	"I don't think Professor Harris is a particularly good teacher , but he is very passionate about his subject . He becomes excited while discussing calculus , and it is a joy to be in his class room , even if his lack of instructional prowess means I have to do extra work on my own ."	"I spent a summer at an art camp , teaching children ranging in age from 4-10 how to paint ."	"I liked it because I got paid to paint all day , and it was inspiring to see the joy in the children . They were a handful , for obvious reasons , but it was a blessing to work with them ."	I would spend it on my mother .	My mother really likes photography . I would buy her a more advanced lens so she could continue doing what she enjoys with better equipment .	"Especially when my dad was deployed , my mom was always there for me . She has shown me unconditional love . I can never pay her back for what she has done for me , but a gift like this would at least show my appreciation ."	My best friend is named Victoria .	"Victoria is a loyal person , and if I ever needed something , she would go out of her way to help me . We haven't always seen eye-to-eye on all topics , but we have always been able to have a constructive conversation about it where both were respected on the same level . She is fun to be around- exciting and peaceful in the right proportion ."	"She was originally my best friend because of close proximity . Now , she is my best friend because of longevity . I can always count on her , and she can rely on me for the same ."	"I tend to take the leadership role , although I can be an effective follower ."	"I would want people of different backgrounds so they may bring different perspectives . However , all of them must be open-minded , hard-working , dependable , dedicated , and honest ."	"Before , people who know me best have said that I am extremely loyal and I engage freely in selfless service . I have also been told that I bring peace and acceptance to an atmosphere , regardless of the population ."	"I recently befriended one of my RA's . We go to bible study together , and I helped her organize the event . She told me in private about her high opinion of me . I was extremely humbled to hear it , because I likewise think highly of her ."	"Like I said , I am an overbearing authoritarian who is easily frustrated when other people don't work as hard ."	My dad told me about my worst flaws after I asked him how to improve myself . He brought up these traits and used JROTC as a reference .	"I have the spiritual gift of mercy . I am also double jointed in my elbows , haha ."	"In JROTC , I was deeply invested in goals and helped people who both physically and mentally hurt me , but I never quit ."

I approach things logically and rarely , if ever , allow feelings to influence my decisions . I enjoy being around people and often "" shut down "" if I am alone for extended periods of time but also value quality alone time ."	I I I love to work out and aim to do so every day . I greatly enjoy reading and spending time with friends by going places and doing fun things .	"I definitely am not one for romantic movies . I prefer action , sci-fi , or comedy . A funny chick flick every now and then is also enjoyable . My favorite TV show is Big Bang Theory or How I Met Your Mother . My favorite movie is probably Armageddon or the Star Wars series ."	"I relate to several characters on Big Bang Theory . I am an engineering student , and seeing the awkward , nerdy interactions of the characters hits at home with me , though I like to think I am not quite as nerdy as they are . Armageddon is my favorite because the soundtrack is fantastic and because the story revolves around astronauts , which is my career goal ."	I also enjoy	"The Harry Potter series allows me to get lost in a different world , and I love how interconnected the books are . Each time I re-read the series , I try to make new connections . Regarding The Lost Symbol , it has a great deal to do with symbolism and mystery , and I enjoy thinking about those things and trying to figure them out ."	"I arrived at the Harry Potter series much later than its prime , but my older cousin was obsessed with the books . My mom recommended The Lost Symbol to me ."	"I hear London is the business capital of the world , and I would enjoy living there . I enjoy the cosmopolitan atmosphere , architecture , and culture ."	"I would love to discover new places and meet interesting people . I would hope to further my career as an engineer in the massive city , and I would also enjoy shopping there ."	"I generally lie if and only if it benefits another person or if it helps me get out of a commitment I simply do not have time to do . I never cheat , though , because I must do things for myself and do not trust others to do things correctly ."	"Awful as in bad habits ? No , I am generally highly in control of my actions . Awful as in "" I literally cannot break this habit , "" yes , and that would be drinking coffee ."	"Definitely physics , astronomy , anything to do with space ! I have wanted to be an astronaut for as long as I can remember , either that or NASA Administrator . I love figuring out how the universe works , how rockets work , how technology works , etc ."	"In fifth grade , my earth science teacher noted how interested I was in the section about outer space . She suggested I go to Space Camp over the summer , and I went five consecutive summers after that ."	"I research things all the time on NASA's website , and I am currently in school for engineering . Last summer , I had an unpaid internship at the NASA center in Huntsville , and I hope to be back this summer . I have joined several organizations on campus that allow me to get hands on with my passions ( e . g . , the Robotic Mining Competition team , sponsored by NASA ; and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics ) . I frequently read books about the history of space flight as well ."	"I'd like to be a mechanical engineer working in the aerospace industry . I chose mechanical engineering over aerospace engineering because I am highly interested in robotics and aspire to develop them . My dream career would be to work at NASA , and then to either move my way up the ranks and become NASA Administrator or become an astronaut ."	"I enjoy solving complex problems and feeling elite . I know that sounds selfish , but there is something about being able to solve and create things that other's can't that appeals to me . Also , how outer space is associated with the aerospace industry draws me to it ."	"I have a 3 . 62 GPA , which is decent at Auburn . I would rather have a 3 . 8 , but I cannot change what has already happened . This semester , I am enrolled in more engineering-related courses , and though they are hard , I am loving them and do not regret my decision to choose engineering ."	I guess	"In Calculus I , I had a mid-A , and in Calculus II , I currently have a high B ( but we have had only one exam ) ."	"Definitely my physics professor ! He has very punny jokes and a sarcastic sense of humor , which matches mine perfectly . He makes class entertaining ."	"I like his sarcastic and punny sense of humor because it matches mine . Also , he teaches class very interactively rather than lecturing to us all ."	My unpaid internship at NASA last summer is by far the best job I have ever had	"I mean , it was NASA ! ! I was constantly in a state of "" Am I really doing this ? Is this actually happening ? "" . Being around so many intelligent engineers and scientists was enthralling , and I realized that they struggle to figure things out just like I do . They aren't superhuman , and that helped me realize so much . I also got to participate in several workshops and network with many NASA engineers ."	Definitely my mom .	Whatever she wants . I would probably take her on a shopping spree somewhere nice because she rarely buys things for herself but always buys things to give me .	"My mom rarely thinks of herself first , and when the budget was tight in the past , she spared nothing on me but instead herself went without . I want to give her something she truly deserves ."	Probably Madeleine O'Donnell .	"Her personality is just like mine--we are both ENTJs . She is highly driven and understands not to talk to me when I am trying to figure out a problem , and she knows just what to say--or not say--when I am having a bad day ."	"We are basically the same person , yet she is interested in history and I am interested in science . In that way , we both learn from each other ."	I definitely need to lead and hate when my ideas are shut down or ignored .	"I would want them to agree with my approach of getting things done but definitely point out something if it is not efficient or is just plain wrong . Also , I need someone highly intelligent to run through my plan to see if there is a flaw . I prefer to orchestrate everything and critique the final product , and I often find myself doing most of the work ."	"No , I am not a know-it-all . I do not boast about the things I have done or know because I know there is still so much I have yet to learn ."	"My high school notables , for sure . I was voted most intelligent , most likely to succeed , and even most fashionable . After I gave my graduation speech as valedictorian , so many people in the audience told my parents how great I am ."	I am selfish with my time . I will not drop everything to take care of someone but will definitely eventually take care of said person when I finish all of my responsibilities . I am not an emotional person and am quite bad at comforting people .	"A friend I used to tutor annoys me incessantly with snap chats , phone calls , and text messages . He is too needy and pushy , and I often promise to visit him when I go home for the weekend but never do because he wastes my time with small talk and things I do not care about ."	"I am driven and motivated almost to a fault , which is something not many people have nowadays . I have a strong work ethic and refuse to cheat . For example , in a computer programming course last semester , my classmates had a group chat set up and constantly sent answers to the complex homework . Though I struggled for days trying to figure out one coding problem , I refused to use those answers and instead took a 40 / 100 on the homework . I want to earn things , not have things handed to me ."	"When I feel like I am incapable of things , I basically "" shut down "" and only do what is necessary . I have no motivation or drive any longer since I am under the impression I am incapable . This is the only instance in which my emotions control me ."	Probably playing the piano and isnging . * singing	Female	80.51031284	57.53901184	48.44908258	99.95031973	87.86171882	99.37107204	89.89067203	25.92745099	22.10215784	72.297005	0.002907133	3.86E-09	3.31E-05	61.16260286	59.83933936	47.29009699	47.8552018	79.80513638	70.15422314	41.29134825	72.64002961	66.7846798	71.64495135	93.27558512	62.24067938	65.24847782	42.22527045	66.07311467	97.23766034	99.99999517	98.24828656	99.99540299	91.9624688	93.23549988	99.98430867	3.13E-08	2.600365486	0.072165768	7.25E-09	0.009580319	2.62E-08	96.05718412	97.55320088	78.41202029	0.017668377	0.005076572	96.25088033	99.95031973	99.37107204	79.80513638	70.15422314	72.64002961	93.27558512	62.24067938	65.24847782	42.22527045	0.328965349Chatham Cabelka	I am a somewhat introverted person .

I truly believe that everything happens for a reason . I would also consider myself outgoing and love to have a good time ."	My favorite thing to do in my spare time is to hangout with my friends !	I also love	It always puts me in a good mood because it makes me laugh constantly .	I loved	It is my favorite because I felt like the family was really relatable .	We had to read it in class .	I think	"If I ever lived there , hopefully I would have my nursing degree and have a job , but on the weekends I would love to just sit on the beach and relax ."	"I would be lying if I said I never lie , no one is perfect but I also try not to lie . The biggest reason behind why I lie is because I don't want to upset or disappoint someone ."	The only thing I do often that I would consider to somewhat be a bad habit is drinking and partying . I don't typically let it effect my school work though . I only allow myself to go out if I have all my work done .	I am passionate about the people I love and care about .	My family is very close and maybe that's what started it . They would do anything for me and vice versa .	I keep in contact with them all and make sure they are doing ok	I really want to be a nurse .	I really like that I wouldn't be sitting behind a desk everyday doing the same thing over and over . Each day would be different and I would always be on my feet . I also really enjoy caring for others and helping others .	I think I am doing good so far . I am a little stressed about actually apply to the nursing program here and getting accepted .	I know that sounds lame but I am a math person and totally hate English . I really enjoyed	I got and Sorry didn't mean to send that so soon . I got and A in my math class and I just got a B on my first chemistry exam .

I waitress for two years in high school and I loved	"I like it because each day was different , your are constantly interacting with people , and you are always on your feet ."	I would spend it on my mom and dad	For my mom I would probably spend it on a painting of my grandfather who recently passed away .	My mom has done so much for me and I want to do some thing for her . I would get the painting because she loved my grandfather so much and the painting would be something she would have forever .	My best friend is Millie Drake .	She is super bubbly and always cheerful . She is also very laid back and loves to have a good time . She also always has my back .	She is my best friend because we really understand each other and know what each other needs .	During highs school I played lacrosse every year . My junior and senior year I was captain . I really enjoyed that position as junior when we had a coach but my senior year it wasn't as fun because we had no coach . I had to fill the role of a coach and was in charge of literally everything . It is hard to be in charge of people your own age or older because they are not always nice about it .	People who would work hard and not give up but at the same time still have fun with it .	I think they would say that I always find the positive in things .	Our end of the season banquet my coach said nice things about me and the hard work I had done .	My worst quality would probably be that when I do stuff I typically go all in and shouldn't care as much as I do about it .	One time I planned a surprise birthday party for a good friend and it didn't go as planned and it put me in a bad mood the rest of the night .

I like to hang out with my friends in my free time . I play the saxophone so I also really enjoy music . And Auburn is my favorite place on Earth	I mostly spend it hanging out with my friends . We will go out to eat or watch movies at my house	My favorite tv show is The 100 . My favorite type of movie is romantic comedies	"The 100 is packed with adventure , death , and romance . It is based off a really good book trilogy"	"My favorite book would be The Series of Unfortunate Events , the entire book series"	"It was filled with challenging words and concepts . There was mystery . It always kept me wanting to read the next book , until I had read all 13 of the books"	I read it when I was in elementary school because a friend had just started reading it and show told me when she turned it back into the library . So I went to check it out .	"I honestly want to live in Italy , any city is good to me . I love italian food and the culture is so laid back and nice ."	I want the hotels to be music themed and I want to meet people from all over the world	I try my very best not to lie and be deceitful . Sometimes telling a lie would hurt the person less than the truth so I do it for the sake of the other person's feelings	I do not do my work as quickly as I should because I spend too much time on Netflix . Or I eat out too much and spend too much money . I also have an obsession with Hobby Lobby decor pieces that I always buy on impulse if I go into that store .	"I am passionate about music , my friends , family , and especially Auburn"	my passion for music started mostly in high school because of how much I enjoyed marching band and jazz band . Being in the AUMB has made my passion grow even more	"I joined the AUMB , which had been my goal for the last 4 years ."	I want to be a hotel owner . Having my own hotels all over the country and in Europe	Meeting new people from all parts of the world is what is most attractive to me . Hotels feel like home to me as well	"So far , so good . I am taking my Intro to Hospitality class right now and I look forward to this class . I love it so much"	Intro to Hospitality Management	"So far , I am doing very well . I recently wrote a 5 page paper for that class"	Matt Kearley	"I had him last semester and this semester . He makes class very interesting and fun . He is really funny and tries his best to keep everyone engaged during the lecture . He likes to show funny pictures or videos to help us remember what we are talking about . I honestly love that class , even if I'm not very good at biology"	I love	Kids are so happy and full of life . They always make me smile . And I guess I liked being able to be in charge	I would spend it on my mom	"I would put it towards buying her a house , which is something I have promised her I would do in my life ."	Because I love my mom and she has done so much for me . She works harder than anyone I know . She keeps living in different apartments and I want her to have a house of her own	Her name is Cynthia	"She is happy , energetic , fashionable , gorgeous , and one of the nicest people I have ever met . She cares so much about me and my happiness than anyone ever has ."	Because of how much we care about each other . We love to spend as much time together as we possibly can	I prefer to be the person in charge	"I would pick strong , confident , smart , talented , and nice people for my team . I am very driven by competition so being the best is almost always the top priority on a team for me ."	"They would say I am very positive , happy , outgoing , social , talkative , and short"	I have had people tell me how much they appreciate how positive I am because I can keep people motivated and happy	I have severe anxiety so I stress out a lot . I can also get angry quickly depending on a situation because all my anger just builds up over time because I try so very hard not to be angry	"I was hosting a party at my house and even when the guests started showing up , I was still running around my house trying to make everything perfect and people were taking notice of my emotional state and were trying to help me but I didn't let them . I was on the verge of a breakdown"	I think I have a unique sense of style . And a unique level of positivity that not many people h ave .	I once had an anxiety attack right after band rehearsal . I couldn't breathe or move . I just sat in my car for 45 minutes until I could some-what control what was happening . It was because of how stressed out I was over school .	I could play the saxophone .

I work hard for my goals , and I hold myself up to a very high standard ."	I like to take it easy and relax at home .	My favorite TV show is the Bachelor / Bachelorette on ABC .	I've watched it ever since I was young with my mom . I like it because I thin k the drama within the show is funny .	"My all-time favorite book is "" Frankenstein "" by Mary Shelley ."

The personality of this place is very adventurous but calming during the wintertime ."	I would go explore places that tourists don't commonly go . Places that are important to the culture	"Sometimes to make people feel better in an uncomfortable situation , I feel I need to tell a little white lie . However , I think being honest is very important ."	I have been biting my fingernails ever since I was little . It's a pretty terrible habit and I haven't been able to stop due to my anxiety in certain situations .	"I'm passionate about working hard to achieve my goals . I have overcome many situations of adversity , so I feel that the only way to succeed is to lift yourself and others up ."	"I've always been a hard worker , especially in my schoolwork .

"I'm unsure of what I want to do , but I am leaning toward a profession in the health-related field . I'm thinking about biomedical sciences or working in a laboratory ."	Attention to detail and organization	I'm doing pretty well on the path to my professional goals .	My favorite courses include chemistry and biology .	I did fairly well in them .	My favorite professor is Prof . Guistino . She was my history professor .	"I HATE history . She made me at least enjoy the course because of her attention to details , and she genuinely wants students to do well . She hugged me after I turned in my final exam ."	My favorite one was at Springhouse Restaurant . I was a hostess and a waiter's assistant .	"The environment was so friendly and supportive , and I felt like I was appreciated ."	I would invest the majority of it and donate the rest to someone that needs it more than I do .	"If I had to spend it on one person , it would be my husband . He's so supportive and he deserves the world ."	I would buy him a new computer because he loves gaming a lot . I chose him because he's always supported my goals .	My best friend is Kayleigh .	"My best friend is quirky , fun , and supportive . She's so loving and we have always been friends ever since we were 1 or 2 years old ."	"She is my best friend because we accept each other through the good and bad situations in our lives . We grew apart when she moved away , but we always kept in contact . She's supporting , loving , and quirky , just like me !"	"I prefer to coordinate jobs on a team and make sure everyone is on task .

I am open to any personality traits on a team because they are all beneficial ."	"I think people would describe me as funny , supportive , and organized ."	"Whenever I tell a joke in an awkward situation , everyone becomes at ease and they tell me that I am funny . Also , they acknowledge my organizational skills because of my involvement on campus and the use of my calendar ."	I think they would say that I am over-analytical and too quick to judge .	I often take what someone says and blow it out of proportion . My thoughts often consume what really happened .	"I think I'm unique because I'm different from a lot of girls on campus . I enjoy exploring , but I also enjoy staying in on a Saturday night . I like to play video games , too ."	"I only open up to a few people , and I often only trust myself when it comes to certain situations . I don't easily open up to a stranger ."	I would have to say my greatest talent helping others overcome a difficult situation .

I mean , when "" Friend Like Me "" started , I got this huge grin on my face , and I started bouncing around . So that was kind of my big Disney moment ."	I just was happy to read and see what life was like	I just really like the characters and the story . There is really nothing much else for me to take out of it .

"Well , when my hair gets too long , I play with my hair a lot . In fact , that is why I had to get a haircut . Also , I do talk too much . I get a little too clingy to people because I really do not feel a lot of love , so I get too attached and come on too strong ."	I am passionate about finding a girlfriend and having a good career as a football broadcaster . I know everyone has a gift and I just want me and that one special person to share our gifts with each other .	"Well , my brother has a girlfriend , and he has not really been the brightest diamond in the mine , if you know what I mean .

Because I hang out with him and his friends more than any other people .	I just prefer to be behind the scenes	"I would proabably like a couple of goofballs , but I mean that in a good way .

I love bettering myself in every way as well as bettering others .	"My favorite movies are Good Will Hunting and Inception , and my favorite TV show is Nikita ."	I love the emotional drama of Good Will Hunting because Will's therapist helps him overcome major emotional trauma that he underwent as a child . I want to be that person for someone that helps them realize how valuable they really are . I like the complications of Inception as well as the in depth story line of helping the main character learn to live with himself .	The 4 : 8 Principle by Tommy Newberry	It changed my life by helping me learn how to control my thoughts to better serve the Lord and to be the best person I know how to be . Thoughts can be debilitating if we don't control them and utilize them appropriately . I now know how to live in the Lord's abundant joy that He set out for us .	My mentors recommended it to me during a time I needed it	"I would live in Nicaragua because I love the people , and they are so willing to learn and accept help because they are a nation in need ."	"I would be part of children's ministries , feeding industries , and any other form of ministry ."	I am very against lying ; telling the truth is always the best option . I have lied in my past because of humiliation and the guilt that came with the lack of truthfulness is not worth it .	"I have some habits that aren't the greatest , but I have been working to change them . The ones I have currently are not "" awful "" though ."	I am passionate about God and sharing his love with others in many different capactities .	"When I was younger and was introduced to Christ , I began to seek him and learn more and more about Him . The more I learn , the more I want to know , and the more I want to help others because that's how Christ helped us ."	"I spend about an hour everyday reading the bible and journaling . I also help lead a youth group at my church with includes leading a drama team . Furthermore , I am heavily involved in a community service organization that serves in many different capacities . I also try to spend time with my mentors who feed God's love into me even more that I may grow and serve others better ."	I want to be Christian Child Psychologist	"I loved helping individuals learn how to better themselves . This profession is not just about making people better , but helping them be better so that they will continue growing and learn how to handle things in a more positive outlook .

"They're my best friends because we are all very similar in some ways , but also different enough to where we learn and grow a lot from each other . We are all extremely caring and dedicated which makes us quite the trio ."	I like to make sure everyone's organized and on the same page . I also like the team to be effective and efficient by designating roles . I typically take the delegating position because I like trying to make things better and I do this by trying to figure out people's strengths and weaknesses and forming a coherent team . I also have developed a lot of good people skills including willingness to serve and willingness to make some tough decisions .	"I want people who are hard working and flexible because you never know how things could change in a moment's notice . I also want people who are willing to encourage teammates because when things get hard , we have to build each other up to push through difficult times ."

"My favorite TV show is Friends . My favorite movie ( s ) are the Marvel movies , Star Wars , Phantom of the Opera , Becoming Jane , Pride and Prejudice , and Les Mis ."	I love Friends because it shows that all you really need in life is a good group of friends who will look after you no matter what and that it is okay to grow up because I will have to at some point . Marvel and Star Wars are my favorites because of the adventures in them and how they also help all that they can . Becoming Jane is about Jane Austen and how she grew up and the lost love that provoked her to write Pride and Prejudice . She was also such a strong independent women and I love that .

I love how no matter what disaster Liesel is hit with , she always gets back up again and pushes on ."

I also can never sit still and I love to travel and go on adventures . Art is just something I love and I believe life would be very dull without it ."	I have managed to combine just about all of those . I often read books to further educate myself of Interior Design which in itself is an art form that designs things and fixes others . Music is just part of my everyday life and I pursue that everyday whether I listen to it or play it .

My favorite movie is Across the Universe and Boyhood . My favorite TV show is How I Met Your Mother	"I love Across the Universe because it is filled with references and song by the Beatles and has a great love story and crucial time in history about war in the 70's . Boyhood is my favorite because it makes me cry and I loved the detail and realistic view of growing up with a single mother as a young boy . How I met Your Mother is my favorite show because the main character is so optimistic and a perfectionist for love and I can relate to that , plus it's a show filled with quirky personalities"	"I don't really read since I am more of a visual learner , but I guess"	Because I enjoyed the theme and plot of troubled characters with distinct personalities and kept my attention throughout the whole book .

I have a lively personality and I love to be with my friends all the time . I laugh constantly and love to joke around . I am a pretty tidy person and like to keep things orderly and in the right place .	"I usually like to spend my free time outside . If the weather is good , I'll go outside to do my homework with friends . If the weather is bad , I usually hang out with my friends in our dorm rooms ."	My favorite TV show would probably be New Girl .	"I like the humor in the show . Also , a lot of my friends think I'm very similar to the main character of the show , so it's funny to watch it with my friends and laugh at how relatable it is ."	My favorite book is The Last Song by Nicholas Sparks .	"When I read it the first time , it just really drew me into the story and I felt like I was there . I also love sad romantic books so all the Nicholas Sparks books are good to me , this one is just my favorite out of all of them ."	"I had watched the movie first because my friends showed it to me , and then when I read the book I realized how much better the book is than the movie ."	"I would want to live in Charleston , SC . It has a very laid back personality and it is full of history . I'm from South Carolina and have always thought"	"I would want to have a design job there . On my free time , I would want to ride bikes and take photographs because the scenery there is just so beautiful ."	"I can't lie . Even if I wanted to , i can't . I have a really strong conscience and so if I try to lie I have to come straight forward because I hate keeping things from people , especially if it is hurting someone ."	"I don't really think I have bad habits . I sometimes watch too much Netflix or eat too much popcorn , but I work out a lot and still get my homework done and keep good grades , so I don't see those as that bad ."	"I am passionate about a lot of things . I really care about the environment , so when I see people being inconsiderate to our environment I get upset . I also really care about animals and animal welfare . I love art and nature and music and I'm really passionate about all three of those because they all evoke strong emotion in me ."	All of those passions have a lot to do with nature and our planet and I think my parents had a lot to do with my passions . We went camping for our vacations so I spent a lot of time outdoors and so I really appreciate the outdoors and preserving nature . They also exposed me to a lot of art and music when I was young so I have always really been passionate about those as well .	"No , I am not kidding . I am a pre industrial design major so I hope to be able to follow my passions with this major ."	"There are just a lot of possibilities with my major , so I want to keep an open mind as I go through college and learn more about the possibilites ."	"I really like hand on things . Industrial Design is very hands on especially because the first thing they teach you is rendering , which is drawing and it looks lifelike . I really like that it is a lot of problem solving because I love problem solving and creating new ideas to make people's lives better ."	"I am doing well . I thought I wanted to be an engineer at first , but then I heard about Industrial Design and researched more , and toured the program at Auburn which helped me to realize that Industrial Design is something that I am much more interested in ."	"I am taking all prerequisites right now , but my favorite class that I have taken was last semester and it was called Design , Invention , and Society . It was such an interesting class and the professors were really amazing ."	"I did well , I got an A . It wasn't hard to prepare for the class because it was so easy to pay attention in class and remember everything they had said ."	I think	"The way they taught , I didn't even have to study for the class because I was able to retain the information because they made it so interesting . They were both really funny too . They jointly taught the class so they alternated days so I never got bored ."	I only have done babysitting jobs and I worked a few months at Panera . I really didn't like	"Babysitting was fun because kids are so innocent and fun and they are always wanting to be active , so there's no time to be bored . It's also really easy to make kids laugh so it's fun to try and make them laugh really hard ."	I would spend it on my mom .	"I would buy her anything she wanted . She's the most generous person I know and just got a job this year and whenever she gets a paycheck , she always spends it on her kids and other people and never anyone else . I think she would like if I paid for a trip somewhere . She loves to travel and explore ."	She is the most selfless person I know . She deserves it because she is always spending her money on others and never putting her self first . She deserves a vacation because she has a lot going on in her life and I know how much she loves to travel so she would love to be given a trip .	My best friend is my friend Zoe who I have known since I was 4 .	She is really sarcastic and so supportive . She is such a loving and encouraging person and is always thinking about the well-being of others above herself . She never fails to make me laugh and if I'm having a bad day she will show up at my house to hang out .	"She has always been there for me and even though we have gone to different schools since 6th grade , we are still able to be great friends . I think this is hard to do for most people , because if you don't see them everyday , it's hard to remember to make time for them , but we always are able to make time for each other and plan facetime dates ."	"I will play any part on a team , but I usually prefer to help lead . I don't like to be the only leader but I like to help lead and make sure my voice is heard ."	"I would want someone who is determined , one who is really good at time management , and one who is good at compromising . I am good at the artistic part of things so I need people to help me manage my time and stay on track ."	"They usually say that I am very encouraging , motivated , and fun ."	In highschool we had to do similar things like this and when we had to write three words to describe ourselves we would always as our friends and those were the ones people usually said for me .	"My worst qualities are that I stress out too much about small things , I am a perfectionist and sometimes that is good but sometimes it isn't and can really cause stress for me and others , I also procrastinate a lot ."	I really don't have a specific example that includes all of these qualities . These are just qualities that show up in my personality a good amount .	I am a creative person and I think that makes me unique . I also think I have a unique sense of humor .	"I have a really hard time deciding things . Whenever my friends ask me to make a decision about making plans or where we are going to eat , I hate deciding and I have a hard time ."	I think my talent would be double dutch . I learned in elementary school and not many people can do it .

I made sure I got pointers on how to do well , and expressed my interest in the course ."	She liked me . I like people that like me . I also flattered her a little . I told her that my parents took art history and said it was a valuable class . Everyone likes feeling like their area of study is valuable .	I've really only ever had one job . I worked as a tutor with one of my teachers from middle school .	"I know I sound redundant , but I was good at it . I mostly tutored high school freshman and middle schoolers . The things they were learning were foundational to my current classes ."	"I would spend it on my sisters . Janey and Lucy are my best friends . I've always tried to get them stuff with my money .

I don't want to buy them something they don't want . I'd want them to be happy with their gift .	"Outside of my family , Sara is my best friend . She's the one with the terrible boyfriend .

I need one person as smart as me to bounce ideas off of . I also several other people who will do what I say without question .	It depends on who you ask . My parents will say I'm smart and driven . My friends will say I'm funny and sarcastic . My sisters know that I have the uncanny ability to determine what people will do and say next .	"Last year when I graduated high school , lots of people talked to me about my best qualities . This isn't because they were particularly impressed , but because that's what you do when someone graduates high school . They said I was smart , and driven , and would succeed at what I choose to do ."	"Easy . I'm bossy , and somewhat emasculating . I don't put up with other people's weakness , and I don't trust them easily because I have been consistently let down by a string of people in my life . I'm harsh , loud , and opinionated . I also worry way too much and examine my own motives constantly ."	"Like I said , I criticize my sisters a lot . When I do this , they say I'm harsh or "" like a man "" which basically means I'm driven and know what I want . I've told them they need to try harder or they're gonna wind up with crap jobs . Sometimes I feel like it's my place to tell them what to do , and they don't like it ."	"I don't think people are overall unique . You may be unique for a certain area , but most people are average .

"I have two . I worked at a laser tag place my senior year of high school which is so much fun and prior to working there , I use to volunteer at hospitals . That was a great experience and I met some cool people ."	At the laser tag place it was my first job and I just got to work with people my age . It was an easy-going job . It was rarely boring and my bosses were so easy to talk to and very supportive . With the volunteering it just kept me humble . I learned a lot about myself and others .	I would spend it on my mother . She has done so much for me .	"I would buy her whatever she wanted . It probably wouldn't be this one big thing , but little items that add up to the $ 1 , 000 ."	I chose my mother because she's given so much to my brother and I . She's just a self-less person . One day I want to be able to treat her and my dad .	"My best friends are my mom , my friend Vedica , and my friend Maiya ."	All of them are funny and interesting people . They're understanding people who give good advice . I can be my authentic self around them which says a lot about their characters .	"Once again , there's never a dull moment with them and I can be my true self around them all ."	"On a team I don't like to be the leader , but I do like to have a large input and play a major role ."	"Ideal partners on a team would be people who are selfless , hardworking , but also people who like to have fun . You need people who think of others and who think of team and you need people who get their work done . But , you don't need boring people . You have to have a little fun too ."	"They would say I am a happy person who truly cares about the well-being of others . I am sensitive , but strong at the same time . I try my best to be the best person I can be ."	One time I had an interview to do and I asked my closest friends what do they think are my best qualities . I needed help with this question and it was interesting to see their answers .	"They would say I worry way too much , I sometimes look down upon myself , and I can be very picky ."	"My friends just know that I am a worrier . I sometimes have anxiety and stress out myself too much . Some of them know that I grew up having self-esteem issues as well . I've overcome a lot of them , but I'm still building my confidence ."	I just think as human beings no one is exactly like us . Me being me is unique . I have little quirks and different ideas that make me who I am that some other people may not have .	"I just always get a littler nervous about certain outcomes . I try to not care about what people think or to be 100 percent positive , but sometimes and most of the time I let my anxiety get to me . I care a lot about what people think of me ."	I would probably sing .

I am a student at Auburn University where I study exercise science . I have a lot of interests including travelling , running , painting , drawing , playing the violin , reading , and cooking . I love the outdoors , animals , and people ."	I like to draw pictures and read books .	My favorite movie series is Lord of the Rings .	I enjoy the massive scope of the series and the interrelationships between the characters .	Definitely the Dark Tower series by Stephen King .	It is simply magical . The characters are rich with personality and the plot is thick . The setting spans from the an abandoned post-apocalyptic desert to modern cities . It is a science fiction version of a western movie .	I found it on my own . I read Stephen King a lot and discovered that was his magnum opus and dove head first into it .	"I would like to live in Miami , Florida or San Diego , California . Both of these places are warm , full of activity , close to the water , and exciting ."	"I would enjoy swimming , boating , going to concerts , running through the park , making friends , working , going to school ."	"I gave myself a 2 because I am a very honest person . When a lie avoids conflict , I still choose to voice the truth because honesty is the priority . But in the case of protecting a child's feelings , I would conjure a white lie to console them until they are ready ."	Sometimes I tend to overindulge in my bad moods instead of accepting them for what they are . I can use them as excuses instead of preventing myself from causing hurt to others .	I am passionate about bringing ability and hope into the world .	"It started as an innate interest . I love exercising and I wanted to transform one of my favorite free time activities into a career . Throughout my life , I've also encountered many people who struggle to lead a normal life with ease of walking either due to accident or genetics . I love making people smile , and inspiring people to be their best selves . So all three of these passions combined into one big passion of helping and motivating others to help themselves through physical therapy ."	"I have been a student at Auburn for three years . I continue to run and exercise and learn more about the human body . I have recently begun looking into shadowing physical therapists , and reading more about the different routes and paths I can take with my career . I have also applied at a summer camp for enabling disabled children to do 'normal' activites like fishing and sailing ."	I want to become a physical therapist .	"The interpersonal relationship between the doctor and the patient speaks to me . Working with people instead of in a cubicle attracts me . I love the human body , and helping others heal their injuries ."	"I am doing great . I have one more year of undergraduate studies , then three years of graduate school before I am a licensed physical therapist ."	My favorite course is anatomy .	"The first time I took Anatomy , I did very poorly ; I did not study , I skipped class , and I ended the class with a very low C . I knew that I was capable of better things , and I am retaking the class right now and I currently have an A in the class ."	My favorite professor in college was my introduction to physical therapy professor Rodrigo .	"Rodrigo was very personal . He broke the wall between teacher and student and became my friend . He was very real , and loving , and supportive , and offered guidance through personal struggles ."	My favorite job was laying sod for a landscaping company .	I loved being outdoors and sweating in order to complete a task . I worked on a team with others and I was able to practice my Spanish with my coworkers while having friendly conversation and getting a full body workout .	My mother .	"I would buy her new shoes , new jeans , flowers for her garden , a new chair for her business , and jeans ."	"My mother sacrifices many things in order to provide me with the life I live , and I want to return the favor to her . My mother wears her shoes until the have holes in them , along with her clothes . She loves the outdoors and loves planting flowers ."	My best friend is Bradley	My best friend is intelligent and caring . He is very playful and optimistic and interested in many things . He does not pretend to be somebody he isn't . My best friend is very caring and intelligent . He is optimistic and has many interests .	He is my best friend because we exist on the same wavelength and understand each other .	I enjoy being both the leader and the supporter .	"I would choose people who enjoy cooperation . They would be patient , open-minded , creative , and motivated to tackle even the most wild ideas ."	"They will say that I am optimistic , that I love life , and that I am a hard worker with clear goals ."	"I struggled with being a poor student last year , but knew that my goal was to graduate and become a physical therapist . I reoriented myself in order to make that happen ."	"People will say that I can be impatient , irritable , and sad ."	I have struggled with depression and that has affected a lot of my personal relationships .	"I believe that I have an insatiable hunger for knowledge . I love learning . I love spontaneity . I adapt to change well , and I love growing from uncomfortable situations ."	I constantly worry about my appearance every day .	I would explain a complex problem in simple terms .

I love being around my friends . I am a very compassionate person .	I enjoy serving in my church . I also enjoy playing sports and working out . Video games are another thing I like to do .	My favorite movie is The Equalizer and my favorite TV show is either SportsCenter or Impractical Jokers .	I like The Equalizer because the character Denzel Washington is fighting for someone who cannot fight for them self . I like to watch SportsCenter because I love sports . Impractical Jokers just makes me laugh and I love to laugh .	The Bible	Because it is God's Word . There is so much to learn in it and so many things to take away from it .	My family first introduced me to the Bible when I was very young .	"I would like to live in Birmingham , Alabama . It has multiple personalities that can fit anyone who wants to live there . I like the small town feel"	"I would enjoy going to my church , going to sporting events at my old high school , going to the movies , going bowling , and going to Baron's games ."	Sometimes I tell lies if I don't want to hurt someone's feelings . Another time I would lie is to avoid conflict with someone . I would also lie or exaggerate a story to make it funnier . Overall I try not to lie though .	I do not have any bad habits . The only habit I have that I would consider bad is procrastination but I don't know many people that don't procrastinate .	"The things I am most passionate about are God , my church , my friends , kids , and sports ."	My passion for God started from a very young age . I come from a Christian home so I fell in love with God from the start .	I am currently doing an internship with my church and after this semester I am transferring to my churches ministry school to become a youth pastor .	I want to be a youth pastor .	"First of all , getting to teach people about the Lord . Another thing would be working with kids every week . I look forward to pouring into them and watching them grow into young men and women of God ."	I am doing great . My passion grows for it each and every day and I am taking steps to achieve my goals .	I love	I currently have an A .	Probably Professor Buchanon because she takes the time to get to know us a little more than other professors do .	She shows interest in what everyone has to say and doesn't think anyone's answers are stupid . She wants to hear what everyone has to say .	I have only had one job . It was at an Italian restaurant and I was basically a busboy . It was not the most fun job in the world but it paid well .	I liked it because it paid well and I didn't have to work that often .	Probably my mom . She's struggled with finances most of her life and it would benefit her a lot .	I would use it to help pay her bills .	I chose my mom because I love her even though we've had our rough patches . I would pay for her bills because that is what she needs the most .	My boy Richard .	He is hilarious . He loves sports just like me . He is pretty relaxed most of the time but can get crazy when he's in the mood . He loves God and his family . He's pretty loyal too .	We have a lot of similarities and we just get each other . We have a really good connection .	I like being a role player . I don't wanna be the star player or anything like that . I just want to do what's asked of me and support and encourage my teammates .	I like people who don't mind stepping up and taking the lead every once in a while . I would also want my teammate to be selfless and not crave attention . Someone who is willing to work as a unit with others .	I think they would say I'm a pretty genuine guy . I like to think I'm generous and selfless . I would want them to think of me as a nice guy as well .	I usually like to pay for people's food . My friends usually tell me I'm a generous person .	I tend to procrastinate more than I should . I get kind of careless and too relaxed at times .	Usually just when I have a project due I wait until the last minute to finish it .	I believe I have a unique quality of compassion and feeling other people's pain . I try to sympathize with people as much as possible .	"Whenever I play sports , I often get frustrated if I do not perform well ."	I would probably try singing .

"I would like to live in Charleston , South Carolina . I love how cute and quaint it is . I have been there once and loved walking around and seeing the sites . It is beautiful there and seems like a great place to raise a family ."	I would enjoy walking around and seeing the part Charleston with all of the colorful houses .	"I sometimes have trouble with not wanting to hurt people's feelings so much that I do not tell the complete truth . An example of this would be if I do not like someone's haircut , I might still tell them that I do ."	"I leave my room messy , which is not a great habit . Eventually , I will clean it and I feel much better !"	I am passionate about my schoolwork . I work extremely hard and want to do well in school .	"It started in high school when I kept taking the ACT to get my score high enough to get a good scholarship . However , this passion grew once I came to college because I wanted to have a 4 . 0 GPA ."	"I have been studying very hard and getting all of my work done in time so that I can make good grades . Sometimes , I have to make decisions and put school above activities that I would rather do ."	I want to be a pharmacist and I want to work in a hospital .

I like this because I hope to have a family and just work part-time ."	"I am doing well . I will be applying for pharmacy school in the fall , and I am excited for the future ."	I really enjoy Organic Chemistry . I think	"I took Organic Chemistry I last semester , and I got an A in the course . I am currently taking Organic Chemistry II , and I have an A in that class as well ."	My favorite professor is Dr . Kolarkar . He is my Physics I professor .	"I like this professor because he has a different way of teaching than most professors . It is a flipped classroom , but he puts videos online before class and we are required to watch them and take an online quiz . We then go to class and are already exposed to the material , so we are able to just practice when we get to class . He also believes in hands-on learning , so there are many demonstrations and opportunities to get involved with the demonstrations ."	"I was a counselor for a show-choir camp called Summer Show Offs last summer , and I will be returning this summer ."	It has such a family atmosphere and I love the counselors . I love seeing the change in the campers from the beginning of the week to the end of the week . They leave the camp more confident and having just had the best week of their lives .	I would give it to someone in a third world country who needs it for food and shelter .	"I would buy him or her food , clothes to wear , and somewhere to live if he or she does not have a home ."	"I chose that purchase because it is the essentials of life . I chose that person because the people in third world countries are in need , and I am so lucky to have food to eat and clothes to wear , but not everyone has that ."	"My best friend is my roommate , Abbey ."	"She is so caring and kind . She helps people in whatever way she can . She is extremely funny , although she does not try to be . She is not intimidating at all and is so approachable ."	"Our personalities go well together . We are very much alike . I feel comfortable with her , and I could tell her anything because I know she is so trustworthy ."	"I do not like to be the leader . I do not mind doing anything , but I like to be told what to do . I do not like to the be the person in charge . I do not mind having some type of leadership position as long as there is someone above me for me to go to if I have questions ."	They were kind and encouraging .	They will say that I am hard working and sweet . I work so hard in school .	"One time I was told that I never get to enjoy life because I am always working on school . However , I know that I still enjoy life , but I just work really hard in school ."	They will say that I try too hard sometimes and worry too much . I do not just sit back and relax very well . I get stressed out easily .	"I had a Physics test and a lab practical this week , and I was so incredibly stressed and my friends told me that I had studied so much for it ."	"I believe that I am good at making people feel welcome and comfortable . I hate going somewhere and not knowing anyone , so I try to keep that in mind with others ."	My biggest weakness is getting too stressed out and not just letting everything happen as it is supposed to happen .	Dancing !

I love to eat healthy , go to the gym , and hang out with friends . I don't really enjoy parties , though . I'd rather read a book ."	I like to hang out with my friends and relax .	My favorite movie / TV show has got to be The Office .	"I mostly enjoy the humor in it , and I always watch it with my dad so it brings good memories ."	My all-time favorite book is The Boy in Striped Pajamas .	It is my favorite book because it tells a really good story about the innocence of a child and how everyone is equal .	I found the book originally because there was a movie coming out about it and I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie .	"I could live anywhere in the world , I would have to choose Manhattan , NY . I love the energy of the city and I would love a little studio apartment to live in ."	"My favorite place in the world is back home in Boyd , TX . I love hanging out with my parents and taking care of all of my animals ."	I would only tell a lie if the truth would cause a lot of emotional pain . Sometimes there is no reason to cause others pain just so that I could have a clear conscience .	"The only awful habit I can think of is my coffee addiction . I drink around 5-6 cups a day . People tell me it's bad , and I know it is , but I can't stop ."	"I am passionate about my family , friends , and future career ."	The passion started when I worked in a vet clinic . I got really interested in parasites and now I want to be a parasitologist . My family and friends always motivate me .	"Like I said before I worked at a vet clinic , I am taking classes now to pursue my passion , and looking into research opportunities ."	I want to be a parasitologist .	"I like the fact that it involves science , and I like the fact that I will be able to help people by finding cures for deadly parasites ."	"I am doing very well , and working very hard in my schoolwork to get there ."	My favorite course in college is chemistry .	"Last semester I finished with a B + , and this semester I have a C so far ."	"My favorite professor in college is definitely Dr . Cathleen Guistino , my history professor ."	"I love her because she teaches history through the emotions of the people at the time , and it makes it interesting / more understandable for me ."	My favorite job so far has been my internship at a veterinary clinic .	"I liked it because I got along with my coworkers , I got to work with animals , and the hours were great ."	I would probably spend it on food or things that me and my friends can use together .	I would either take my boyfriend out to dinner or I would buy games that my friends and I could play on our game nights .	I chose those people and purchases because I love them and they mean a lot to me .	My best friend is my dad .	"My dad , even though he's forty-two , still has the heart of a kid . He loves to goof around with me and have fun and start new projects ."	He's my best friend because we talk and laugh all the time and no matter what happens to me or what friends come and go he is always there .	I prefer to be the leader of the team but it does not always work out that way .	"My ideal partners would be cooperative and considerate , not super bossy . I would want someone I can work with , not work for ."	I think that they will say I am a hard-worker .	They would probably say those things because I always postpone hanging out with them to do my homework .	People might say that I worry a lot about things or that I can be stressed out a lot .	A specific example would be when my boyfriend was trying to calm me down when I was studying for a really hard test and I yelled at him because I was so wound up .	I believe that I am able to never give up and keep pushing though anything .	One time I thought a guy in one of my classes wanted to be my friend but he only wanted to hook up with me .	My greatest talent that I could use to win would be problem-solving .

"I love to laugh , and think"	"I love to laugh , and think about the goodness of the world ."	"My favorite book would ave to be , "" To kill a Mocking Bird . """	It's a classic book that tells a wonderful and interesting story .	I learned of this book through my high school English class .	I would live in Israel . The personality of this place is rich with culture and history .	"Learning about the history of events that took place there in the past . I have visited many times , and know a lot already , but there's always something else to learn ."	"I lie sometimes to protect others . If a person is self-conscious about themselves and think they're ugly , then I will lie and tell them that they are beautiful / handsome to increase self-esteem ."	Everyone has something they do routinely that isn't necessarily good for them . Anything from biting their fingernails to drug related bad habits . Everyone has something they do .	"I am passionate about religion , family , and the well being of others that are honest and truly helpless ."	"It started with the way I was raised , since I was raised in a respectable home that taught my values ."	"I have been thankful enough to be able to take many trips to Israel to get more in depth with my religious side . My family is also pretty tightly knit , but every family isn't perfect , so there are issues ."	I passionately want to attend medical school to take the next step in making my career .	"I want to be a doctor , more specifically a radiologist ."	"I am doing pretty well , just trying to pull up the GPA to meet the requirements necessary ."	"I am passionate about history , but also very interested in biology . Learning about everything that happened in the past , and learning how the environment and my body work ."	"I did very well in history and biology last semester , but this semester seems to be a little but more of a struggle so far ."	"My favorite would have to be my math teacher . She is Chinese , so I cant really spell her name , but she is just so sweet and explains everything to make it so understandable ."	"I like my professor because she is sweet , knowledgeable , understanding , and can make more difficult concepts understandable ."	I would say mowing people's lawns for them .	"When I am sitting on a lawn mower , I can just have my headphones in listening to music , relax , and just ride around , while actually being productive ."	"I either spend it on my mother , sister , or girlfriend ."	I would buy them something to let them know I appreciate them .	They are the most impactful women in my life .	"Alright , Ill say my girlfriend then , just because we can tell each other absolutely anything ."	"She is the total opposite of me in many ways , but in the core values we are the same . She is fun , spontaneous , adventurous , compassionate about who she is and what she believes in ."	"We can tell each other literally anything , and know each other so well , that we can know what the other is thinking just through body language ."	I like to be the leader that leads by example .	"My teammates need to be cunning , smart , can figure things out on their own , and be able to contribute to the team in their own special way . I like down to earth people , that aren't too prideful of themselves , but also have self confidence in themselves ."	"That I am a down to earth kind of guy , who works hard at achieving his goals , but at the same time wants to experience life to the fullest . So , I like to have a little fun on the side , but am very good at keeping the two balanced ."	"If my friends want to go watch a sporting event , or play at the rec they know I would love to hangout with them , but only if I have my schoolwork done that needs to be done ."	Maybe that I can sometimes think too highly of myself or too competitive .	"We were making 2K players of my friends and I to put on a team together , and when creating my player I said his overall rating should be an 82 , when my friends agreed he should be a 78 or 79 overall ."	I believe my religious qualities are unique compared to most people in the United States .	"Last week my psychology messed up putting my grade in Canvas , and when I saw how low the grade was , I broke down mentally for a night and began to doubt myself .

I would probably spend it on some guys that I know who do not have too much money and would really appreciate the money .

"Good Will Hunting is about someone who is extremely intelligent , yet doesn't quite know what to do with his gift . It also has Robin Williams in it , and I absolutely love Robin Williams . The Big Bang Theory is more about the everyday lives of a couple of friends who just so happen to be scientists , so their interactions in there personal and work lives are interesting ."	The Great Gatsby	"It's about the 1920s , a time when everything was over the top and over-dramatized .

I had to read it for a project in an English class in high school .	"I'd love to live in Savannah , Georgia . It's a very artsy town , and is lively without being too over the top ."	"Revisiting my grandparents old bed and breakfast would also be interesting . When I was younger my grandparents owned a B & B in Savannah , but I was too young to really remember my experiences there . I've gotten to visit it once a while back with my grandmother , but I'd like to get a chance to stay there , even if it's owned by someone different now ."	"I don't like to be untruthful , but at the same time if I absolutely have to bend the truth a little bit to avoid an uncomfortable situation , I'd probably do it ."	"I have the habit of chewing on my lip and picking at the skin on my fingers . It's probably due in part to anxiety , but they hurt my skin , and I would love if I didn't have the habit . I also procrastinate , and that's a habit that I've tried to stomp out ."	I'm passionate about music and science .	"My parents made me start playing piano when I was in fifth grade , and I excelled pretty quickly at it , and really enjoyed playing . I've picked up multiple other instruments since then , and I've continued to play in college ensembles . In high school I had to take core sciences like every other person , but I did very well in them and understood things quickly . Because of this I often helped others , and this gave me a sense of pride in what I did ."	"As for music , I am a part of the Auburn University Marching Band , and I am also in the concert band . As for science , I am a Pre-Med major and intend to go on and become either a neurologist or an orthopedic surgeon . I love anatomy and want to continue to work with the human body , and help others along the way ."	"I want to become a surgeon , working with either orthopedics or neurology . Possibly both , because I'm interested in the process of attaching prosthetic limbs to muscle and nerve fibers to better help those who use them ."	"Working with different problems that people have , and getting the chance to learn more about how the body works . The pay would also mean I would be pretty stable financially ."	"It's been very difficult , because the classes involved are much harder for me than I anticipated . Coming to college I was still used to doing well without putting much effort into what I did , so it's been a bit of an adjustment , but I know that life isn't always going to hand you what you want , so I know I have to work for it ."	Anatomy and Physiology .	"I have a high A in the class , so very well so far . The semester isn't over yet , though ."	Dr . Cagg	"I like him because he helps us understand the material and goes over things with us if we have a problem . My Chem I professor did a very poor job of teaching us , so Cagg has been a blessing because he actually wants you to understand and do well in the class , as long as you're willing to put in the effort ."	Working at a movie theatre .	"I liked it because it was pretty laid back , and we got a lot of free food , which was nice . We also got to watch movies sometimes when we got done cleaning the cinema rooms ."	"I would spend it on my mom , because she always puts others before herself , and she has made an impact on so many people over the years . She deserves the world , so I would use it to show her how much I appreciate her ."	"I'd use the money to take her to dinner somewhere nice , and then take her shopping . It isn't really enough to take her on a neat trip somewhere ."	"I chose my mom because she deserves the best , and I chose that because I feel like she would really appreciate it . I'd love to take her on a big trip out of the country , but it would require more than $ 1 , 000 ."	Corey Nduna	"They are super bubbly and all over the place . He is super funny , and can be really sassy , too . He's a social butterfly and gets along with everyone ."	"Because we have a pretty similar sense of humor , and we can talk to each other about whatever . I trust him a ton , and he also gives pretty great hugs ."	I like to be an advisor .	"People who are go getters and are super smart . I tend to spend too much time on things , so I need someone who knows how to get the job done and keep me on track , yet is also very open to new ideas . I also need people who produce quality work , and put time into it opposed to just getting it done without putting much thought into it ."	"That I put a lot of work into what I do , and that I'm pretty easy going ."	"Nobody has specifically mentioned these qualities , although they do know that I'll stay at the library super late to get work done , and they've never expressed anything that would say that I'm overzealous ."	That I'm very bad at communicating via cell phone .	"My mom complains to me all the time about how I don't respond to her messages , and I just don't like texting , so friends don't communicate with me a whole lot unless I see them ."	"I don't like to follow trends with clothing , so I just wear whatever I feel like I look good in . I also feel like my artistic abilities are pretty unique ."

I get uncomfortable easily . I am laid back and genuinely care about others to the point where I put them before my self most of the time .	I really enjoy reading or watching sports .	My favorite TV sow is grey's anatomy .	"I like it because while the personal drama is interesting , there is also a lot of medical information ( some inaccurate of course ) and I am very interested in science ."	I am obsessed with the nook every last word .	"The main character in the book suffers from OCD and anxiety , as do I and it really sheds light on what it is really like to live with those disorders ."	You're welcome ! I found it on my own .	"I would live in puerto viallarta Mexico . It has such an artistic , fun , an laid back personality . Overall it makes me feel"	I really like to walk the strip where all the local markets are and interact with the people and look at the beautiful architecture and handmade items .	"I think lying is one of the worst things you can do to another person . Trust is a very valuable thing and it has to be earned , especially if you really care about the person . Overall , I just thing it is morally wrong and the feew times I have done it make me feel horrible and anxious ."	I have a bad habbitof not putting things back where they belong and I also bite my nails but neither of those things hurt me or anyone else so I would not consider them awful .	I am passionate about helping other people and helping aniamals .	Even when I was a child I would cry if anyone in my house would try to kill even an insect . I just like the idea of protecting other living things . Except wasps . . wasps suck !	I am a pre-vet major so I plan to help animals and in turn people for the rest of my life . I also do a lot of volunteer work .	"My ultimate goal is to own my own vet practice and also run a rescue shelter out of it . I also would like to have a husband and children , family is very important to me !"	The face that I would be saving animal's lives and on top of that I would be helping people be happier becayse no one wants a sick pet !	I had a bit of a rough start my freshman year I did not adjust well and did not do as well as I wanted to in my classes . Then I got really sick and had to medically withdrawal and this is my first semester back and things have been going a lot better .	I really like	I do really well ! mostly A's and a few B's	I really liked	He was very open minded and made the class a discussion bases learning and I felt comfotable speaking up and stating my opinion .	I am currently a vet-tech and I absolutely love	I get to do a lot of hands on work with animals and it makes me happy to help them .	My parents	I guess I would help pay for the renovation of the kitchen that they have been wanting to do .	I chose my parents because they have sacrificed so much for me to be able to realize my dreams and be hapy and they deserve it .	Jonathan Major	He is very outgoing and one of the nicest people I have ever mat . He is someone that I trust with anything and everything and he has strong morals and a great family .	He is like my opposite but we are also a like in a lot of ways . We share the same interests but he also brings me out of my shell a bit .	I played softball for 13 years of my life and I was the pitcher which made me the team leader . I was never really a fan of being a leader until I discovered softball . It was the one thing I knew I was good at and it felt nice to put the team on my back .	"I would want people that were easy to get along with and people that were open minded . nothing shuts a team down faster than arguments because people aren't willing to listen to other's input ,"	I think my best quality is that I put other people needs and feelings before my own .	It is in all situations really . I will just do whatever it takes to make other people happy even if it is not exactly what I want .	I think my worst quality is that I get too emotionally invested . Sometimes I just can't let things go .	"For example , the people that I work with when the doctor says that there is nothing else we can do for the animal I usually persist and fight back that there must be something ."	I really do not believe that I am all that unique but if I had to say I guess I would say that I am driven but don't le that drive blind me from others around me .	When I am working and my vet says that we have to give up because there is nothing else we can do to save the animal I always fight back because it is hard for me to just accept that and move on .	"If i was not extremely fearful , I would sing ."

I like meeting new people . I am open minded and like to hear other peoples opinions about things ."	"I like to spend my free time with my friends . We watch movies , play video and board games , and do outdoor activities ."	"My favorite movie is The Nightmare Before Christmas . My favorite shows are Doctor Who , Community , and Family Guy ."	I like Family Guy because it's stupid and smart at the same time . There are some jokes that are just simple physical humor and there are some that are smart pop references .	My favorite book is Ender's Game .	I love sci-fi and adventure and this book is a good mix of the two .	It was one of the choices for my high school's summer reading .	I would love to live in Hawaii . It's a very relaxed environment and the people there like to have fun .	I would also like to learn how to make some of the local cuisine .	I sometimes lie in order to protect others feelings . In cases where I've promised someone to keep a secret I have to lie to keep the secret .	I have a habit of taking my anger out on my boyfriend even though he is not the source of the anger . I am trying to stop doing that because that isn't fair to him .	I like to help people .	My mom has always been the person to go out of her way to help people and I've always looked up to that . It started in elementary school where I made a friend that had really bad anxiety and I helped her through her attacks .	I try to help my friends through the challenges they face .	I want to pursue a career in nursing .	I'll get to help people . I also love the human body and learning about different diseases and ailments .	I officially changed my major to pre-nursing earlier this year and I'm now taking the classes that I need to apply to nursing school . Over the summer I plan to shadow some nurses at a hospital to get some hands on experience .	My favorite course so far has been biology . Learning about how living organisms work is really interesting to me .	I'm in the course now and I'm doing well so far .	My favorite professor is Professor Qualls .	"He's very entertaining and makes a lot of jokes , but still manages to teach the material in a way that I can easily remember . He also teaches us things that will help us in the real world beyond that class ."	My favorite job was working at the concession stand at a ballpark .	I got to interact with people and I like the routine of making food and drinks for people .	I spend it on my mom .	I would buy her a porch for the backyard .	"I chose my mom because I want to repay her for all the things she's done for me . I chose a back porch because right now we have a ramp for the dogs , and I think she would enjoy a place to sit and read ."	My boyfriend is my best friend .	"He's very funny and can always get a laugh out of anyone . He is also intelligent , and I learn a lot from him because he likes to share his knowledge . He's caring and likes to help people ."	"We are very similar people , but the ways in which we are different match well . He is always there for me and helps me even when I don't ask for it ."	I like to be a leader .	I would pick people who are open minded so that we can make decisions quickly without arguing too much . I would also pick hard working and determined people .	I think they'll say something about how helpful I am .	I was on a trip with five of my girl friends and they would mention how helpful I was because I would always get them what they needed without them asking for it .	I am sometimes quick to anger .	If I've had a bad day and then someone says one thing that I don't like I get mad at them even though they didn't so anything .	"My friends call me mom because I like to take care of people when they're sick , or teach people how to do something that is a good life tool ."	Sometimes when I have a lot of school work to do I tend to think to much about the sum of the things that I have to do instead of compartmentalizing and making a plan . This causes me to become frustrated and overwhelmed .	I think that I would do a comedy show that included cool science facts and experiments .

Lying can also help to uncover some people's motives by seeing how they react to things . Little white lies , for the most part , are harmless unless they are of frequent occurance ."	"Honestly , I just don't think I have too many bad habits . I'm pretty cleanly , I abide by the laws , I am not gross or anything . Like the only thing I am thinking of is maybe I sing too much or think too much ? I can be kind of selfish , but that's not a habit now is it ?"	Helping others . Finding contentment in life . Nature . My family .	"Pretty sure it was just ingrained in me from my childhood if I'm honest . I grew up with a close-knit family that I obviously care about . I have always wanted to help and understand others since I could remember . As far as nature goes , I have been enthralled by animals and wildlife since I was little so I am very passionate and pretty knowledgable abput conservation . \"	"I am currently a pre-Med student here and am planning on majoring in Biomedical Sciences and minoring in Psychology so that I may become a doctor , hopefully a surgeon , and help others that way . I talk to my family as often as possible to keep close with them . I also am in the Society for Conservation Biology club and am doing Undergrad research ( I am an aid ) concerning conservation biology ."	"A doctor , specifically a surgeon ."	"I want to help other people with my hands . I want to pour into others and help to solve some of their problems and save some lives . I love science so I like the idea of getting to work in that field . Also , as I was severely premature and really really sick , I want to give back to others just as my doctor did for me ."	Pretty well I would say . My GPA is good and I am doing well in my pre-requisite classes . I have shadowing lined up and have already started researching med schools and reading medical memoirs and journals to prepare myself .	Chemistry .	I got an A first semester and have an A currently .	"I have two favorites . I can't really say one over the other as they teach in different fields , but my favorite professors are Dr . Yngard ( Chem ) and Mr . Murphy ( Psych )"	They both are just so passionate about their respective subjects . They explain the material well and keep lectures interesting and funny .	I have only had one job and that was ( and is currently ) as a model .	I like getting to dress myself up and get all doled up and just kind of relax in front of the camera . It gives you a sense of self-esteem and exhillaration like no other .	"I would honestly want to divide it between several people , but if I have to pick one person it would be my dad . He has given so much to me and sacrificed so much and I feel like I sometimes don't show him how much I appreciate him . Plus , he is hard to shop for as he is picky and doesn't like big-name brands , so $ 1000 would help me to get him a lot of small things or more meaningful things that he would enjoy like baseball tickets ."	It depends . I might buy some small knick-knack things or sports memorabillia . I would probably buy him a vacation or something to some sort of sporting event .	I love him more than anything in the world and I want to show him how much I appreciate how great of a dad he is to me and my siblings .	My brother and my sister ( I am a triplet )	"They have different personalities . My sister is very light-hearted , outgoing , and happy-go lucky . She loves to laugh . My brother is goofy but he is also so well-read and smart ."	I can't imagine a life without them . They are both basically an extension of myself .	I prefer to be a leader .	I would want people who had a clear sense of direction on where the project was going . I would want them to be motivated to finish the project efficiently and quickly . I would also want them to be creative and have ideas that could contribute to the project . I would want them though to listen to and respect me as the leader .	I am intelligent and kind .	I have always been told how intelligent I am as I progressed through school . My parents and friends often cite how kind I am by citing the way I treat my pets or how I try to help others .	I am selfish and vain .	"I think a lot about life but also a lot about myself . As much as I love helping others , I also care deeply about my own intersts and what's best for me . I intend to do well in whatever I do and sometimes that makes me not the most group-friendly individual . I also care a lot about how I physically and emotionally present myself to others ."	Not treally . rally really	I sometimes make everything about me and forget anout others .	I would draw somethin .

Getting to spend a lot of time outside teaching kids how to become better at their instrument and how to march is a lot of fun .	I would spend it on my friend .

He always takes us back no matter how far we've run and he loves us no matter what sins we have committed	My mom and a lot of my friends recommended it	I like the idea of the District of Columbia because it is sophisticated and elegant	I want to own my own firm one day and do a lot of non-profit work on the side for those who can't afford it at the normal price	"Well , sometimes if I'm doing something I know would upset my parents I just dont tell them I did it or if they ask what I was doing I come up with another answer because I believe that I am an adult and can make my own decisions without being reprimanded"	Other than sometimes leaving my room a mess or not cleaning up after myself i cant say that I have terrible habits	"The interests and needs of others , Jesus , running , my family , adoption"	"a lot of them started because I know that I am not on the earth to further my own glory but God's glory and in attempting to do so , looking towards the needs of others has become a priority . I am passionate about running because it keeps me in shape and allows me to escape from the world for a while , passionate about adoption because I am adopted myself , passionate about Jesus because he is my savior , passionate about my family because they rock ! !"	"I try to be very intentional with others and understand them . Pursuing my passion of Jesus means spending time worshiping him daily whether through reading his word , prayer , or song . I run multiple times a week to keep my stamina up for running"	An interior designer and a mtoher	mother	I think the job seems fun because there's something new to do every day . currently i am only in my first year and hoping to get into the program	studio	"i do well , but my instructor is harsh on grading sometimes"	probably my interior professor	she is easy to talk to and we can joke around with her even though we hate her sometimes	My favorite job has been coaching for the high school team i ran on	well it keeps me in shape but also I really love being around the kids and loving on them and encouraging them	I spend it on my parents or someone who is in need or is sick	well i would spend it according to what they needed like if it were medical or sustainability	because I have been very blessed and i realize that not everyone has had that luxury and I want to give back	Rachel	Shes quirky and shes smart . She's studying biomedical engineering . she's going to be the best doctor someday .	she is very dependable and loves me despite the mess i am . i can always talk to her about anything	no \	"i would want to work with people who are determined and dedicated . Cooperative people who are willing to do whatever you tell them to do and will do it to the best of their abilities . they dont have to be the smartest , but they need to be driven"	I think that they will say that I am thoughtful and determined	"I generally think about others and try to help them if i can , i am very encouraging because I know how good it feels to be encouraged . they would say im determined or dedicated because when i start something i finish it"	i get easily annoyed just by little things though	"like if someone says im sorry over and over again because theyre worried that youre mad after youve already told them you arent , that gets me a little"	just that I am always determined to get to the bottom of something or figure out things or finish things	I am not always the most tolerant	photography	Female	44.09890426	9.233834546	61.14268141	97.18573888	16.63990921	30.44452795	49.94673356	56.95602994	23.80765253	73.85427276	62.04464814	27.33104365	99.99998134	54.69858125	81.21954426	73.32839808	80.15988829	85.63095909	88.49951375	60.42636993	99.2721364	85.18249756	66.37099429	99.68508776	88.25233741	100	85.66845121	71.11811467	94.21301476	99.88042748	94.49235345	99.99195178	79.25890847	95.88164223	95.77280514	98.94229636	73.05013007	99.86691561	39.9173865	99.77368356	99.99013888	81.99598738	95.97914695	99.99926548	1.015305509	66.71853906	100	97.18573888	30.44452795	85.63095909	88.49951375	99.2721364	99.68508776	88.25233741	100	85.66845121	7.01276761Anna Pugh	"I think of myself as a very reserved person who tries to push myself out of my comfort zone . I love spending time with my friends and have a huge heart , but it takes a lot for me to trust . I try my best to make new friends when I can and to be as caring as possible ."	I spend most of my spare time with my friends in our rooms or at the park .	I love	"I love friends because it includes both romance and comedy between the characters . As for P . S . I Love You , I find it incredibly romantic and realistic as well as comedic at times ."	I really enjoyed	I like how it has romance and mystery . It is something that isn't very realistic but is incredibly interesting .	I had to read it for an English class during my sophomore year of high school and fell in love .	i would have to say that I would move back to Germany because I loved how lively the community was . There was always something to do and a festival to go to .	I love to travel so just exploring all of the new places and seeing all there is that is different about that place .	I have lied to conserve the feelings of those that I care about in order to keep them from experiencing unnecessary pain . I hate seeing the people I care about hurting .	I tend to worry far to much about things that are out of my control and all it does is cause me strife . I also have a very hard time making decisions because I fear what other people will think of me if I say or do something that they don't necessarily agree with .	I am passionate about my relationships and about volleyball .	I have always had a passion for relationships because I thrive when I have good friends around me . the passion for volleyball developed when I was in the 9th grade .	Continuing to participate in athletics and attempting to grow the relationships I have as well as creating more and not letting the old ones die out .	I have always wanted to be an elementary school teacher and I would love to work with the Department of Defense schools .	I have always loved kids and have loved to help people . I am very caring person and tend to do what is best for others before I do what is best for myself . It just seemed like what I was made for .	I am doing alright . I haven't taken many of the classes that are required for my major yet but the few that I have taken I have loved . I need to work on getting my GPA up because I had one very difficult class last semester that I didn't really need that dropped my GPA .	I love	I got an A in biology last semester and I currently have an A in my math this semester .	Matthew Kearley . My biology professor .	I like him because he really knows how to engage a 300 student lecture hall . He makes everyone want to learn the subject no matter if they hated it in high school or loved it . He truly cares about each and every one of his students and is always available if they need any assistance . He just genuinely wants us all to succeed .	I loved	"I like it because it was the closest thing I could get , at a young age , to the job that i want after college ."	I would spend it on my Mother .	I would buy her a small vacation of her choosing to giver her a break from all of her stresses .	My mother has been taking care of myself and my two sibling since we were born basically on her own because my father is a retired marine and spent a lot of time deployed as well as being stationed places that we couldn't necessarily go with him . She deals with all of our troubles on top of her own and my fathers and still manages to have a smile on her face at all times . She is an absolutely incredible woman and she deserves to be pampered .	One of my sorority sisters Caitlin .	She's also very caring and understanding	She is someone I can tell anything to and won't feel like I'm being judged . She completely understands what I've gone through and I understand what she's gone through ; both of us having fathers in the military .	i like to take the lead on most things unless someone who is more pushy than I am wants to .	"I wold like to have people who take things as seriously as I do . They don't need to have the same views as me , but they do need to be willing to compromise and to be open to other people's ideas and opinions without being judgmental ."	"I think they would say that I have a big heart and want them all to be happy . they may say that I'm outgoing , but i just push myself out of my comfort zone ."	I tend to show everyone i meet that I care about them because everyone deserves to know that someone cares and I want to make sure everyone feels loved .	I have a very difficult time making decisions for fear of what other people will think of me and I think to little of myself . I see the world as a hierarchy in which people are worthy of respect and it is very rare that I see anyone below me .	i can never make the simplest of decisions because I constantly ask for assistance whether that is with outfit choices or makeup of even where to eat or what to do . I also have kept some people from getting close to me because I didn't see myself as good enough for them . I don't want to be selfish and take the good people away from people who deserve them far more than I do .	I believe that I am very open minded and kind herted . I also believe that I am good at forgiving those who have done me wrong .	I think that almost everyone is more worthy than I am and I don't want to take opportunities away from people that deserve it more .	I can dance pretty well .

My favorite thing to do is just hanging out with friends and going to do fun things ! I love to try new things and I'm not scared to meet new people or try new foods or anything like that .	But I	I always get way too emotional when it comes to movies and tv shows . When Derek died in Grey's Anatomy I cried for hours I felt	"Well as I said I really don't have just one favorite , but I guess from all my favorites I love that a director , writer , etc that I don't know and have never met can make me feel so emotional and so personally invested in a story line that has nothing to do with my life directly ."	"I love The Great Gatsby , but how could you not it's a classic . I'm really not into Shakespeare and difficult level reading like that . I also like page turning mysteries and romance novels . I like when a book makes me feel"	I love the Great Gatsby's story line and how the characters talk and act . I also like the way it is written and even the time period chosen . I love imagining Gatsby's great parties and how to him they were all some great romantic gesture to lure Daisy to him .	"Actually we read it in high school which is surprising because usually I hate books I'm forced to read , but I had a really great teacher and I actually really enjoyed analyzing that book ."	"I love Pensacola , FL and really most of Florida but I also love my hometown- Mobile , AL . Honestly I would love to live at either place and ideally I would have a house in Mobile and a beach house in Pensacola . Mobile's personality is just home for me-love , family , and home . Pensacola is relaxed , laid back , and fun ."	"I want to live in Mobile / Pensacola when I'm older but if I could choose one place in the world I would live in Bora Bora and have a permanent vacation lifestyle . I would swim , scuba dive , parasail , tan , boat , etc ."	"Well I pride myself in usually telling the truth but if I had to lie , I would . Lying about a surprise party or something I didn't want people to know about myself that was important or lying instead of revealing something someone had shared to me in confidence is okay is certain situations-so I would if I had to ."	I chew on my cheek which I guess I picked up as a nervous habit but now I just do it when I'm bored . I also have bad habits that I enjoy doing at the time and end up regretting but I do them anyway when I'm in the moment .	"I'm passionate about life and living . I think that everyone was put on this Earth for a reason and everyone is different so that they will be able to live the life according to their plan . I understand wanting to have fun , but when you stray so far that you ruin your whole life before it even began is so crazy to me . I am passionate about life . All life . So also I disagree with abortion and I am passionate about saving lives that cannot defend themselves . It is bewildering to me that someone can see videos and pictures of small hands and feet of an unborn child that was going to have a life only for someone else to decide that the child shouldn't . It is not for us to decide ."	"Well I grew up in Catholic school and although I don't agree with everything about the church , I went on the prolife trip in Washington in highschool and saw horrifying videos and pictures of dead babies . It doesn't matter what you call the children aborted-call them fetus or some clinical term to make it seem more humane , but I saw hands and feet . Hands and feet are not just a blob of tissue . People need to be made more aware and that's what we tried to do ."	I have gone to the pro life march for life in Washington and gone to rallies and prayed .	Maybe a radiologist	Reading xrays seems cool and I like helping people .	"I don't really get what you're asking . I'm still not really sure what I want to do , radiology is just something I've been thinking about ."	I like	"I'm doing okay , I'm in it currently but I really dislike the way our professor sets up tests ."	I guess	He's a good teacher and he seems to care about his students . He is nice and goofy but serious about his subjects and helping his students .	I like	I am good with kids and it's fun .	Mom	Full relax message spa day and new clothes / jewelry .	She deserves it and she is always helping me and the family . She does everything for everyone so she deserves some luxury .	Julie	She's laid back so we don't fight much and she's got a great sense of humor . She always listens to my problems and helps me work through and figure them out . She's always there for me ans has been for 14 years . She gets me and always knows how I'm feeling and cheers me up if I'm down .	She's the only consistent friend who I could hang out with everyday and not fight with . I love her like a sister and I couldn't imagine myself without her . We've been inseparable since the first grade and our families are such good friends now she's honestly just my sister .	I like to be in charge if it's something I'm good at .	"They would be good at whatever task we were doing , they would be serious but not too serious , and hardworking . We would have good team chemistry and get along and understand each others strengths and weaknesses so we could back each other up ."	I have a good sense of humor . I'm a happy person and I enjoy life but I can be serious if I need to be . I am kind and straightforward I can tell it like it is .	People comment on my sense of humor sometimes-I can easily take a joke . But me and friends always go out and have a good time so	I am stubborn and impul sive and I don't always make the best decisions	I don't usually back down from an argument which can sometimes lead to trouble .

I love the outdoors , working with animals , and spending time with friends . I show a lot of perseverance when it comes to my goals and I try to be friendly when engaging with other people ."	"I enjoy spending my free time with my friends , whether it is laying out by the pool when it is warm or cooking dinner together on a weekday . I like to spend my time outside if it is a warm day or inside watching TV on a lazy day ."	I love	"I enjoy the setting of the movie , the landscaping was beautiful , and the underlying theme was very powerful for a female viewer ."	"As noted , my favorite book is Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen because of the limits she pressed as a Regency Era author . It is very inspiring to me to look back through history and see people who challenged society in a subtle and passive way ."	"It is my favorite because not only is it romantic , but it takes two individuals who are full of pride who do not want to admit feelings for each other , as well as , prejudice to each others social bearings ."	I discovered the book through my 12th grade English teacher . She assigned us the book because we were study British Literature .	I would live in Hawaii because it is absolutely beautiful . The personality that I picture for Hawaii is friendly and all inclusive . I imagine	"I would enjoy relaxing on the beach and surfing in the ocean , as well as , living off the land's abundance of fruit ."	I would lie only if I knew that it would prevent the person I am lying to from being hurt . Sometimes I feel as though it is best to not tell the whole truth if the person would be better off not knowing .	I just forgot what the statement was .	"I am very passionate about working with animals , and doing something that benefits not only myself but other individuals ."	"I have always loved animal , but it grew substantially when I started working at a camp where I was managing 42 horses , and teaching kids how to ride ."	"Because I love animals so much , my passion has led me to studying animal science at Auburn University ."	I want to be a Veterinarian .	"Working with animals calms my own anxiety , and I would love to be able to help people that way , by attending to their animals which is an extended part of their family ."

I would want a plethora of individual characteristics i . e . creativity , intelligence , confidence that way everyone could bring something to the table ."	"that I am sensitive to others , that I love to spend time with other people , and that I am passionate about my studies ."	My friend and I got in an argument and she told me one of my best qualities is that I am sensitive to everyone's needs and feelings .	I am negative and can sometimes gossip .	"As a release sometimes I can talk bad about people whenever I am afraid of confrontation , when someone has hurt me instead of talking it out sometimes I vent to someone else ."

But my favorite book is probably Hunger Games .	because it was an easy read and I never got bored . it usually takes me a while to read a book and get through it .

My sisters . They both love to read and are very smart . On one trip they were both reading it and loved it . So I decided to start it as well and see how I liked it . It ended up being like a race to see who could finish up the book the fastest .	I like warm weather and nature places . I would want to live in Australia . It looks beautiful in all the pictures and the people seem wonder	"I would want to try surfing . I would go to the beaches a lot . i love taking pictures of nature , so I would probably go look for beautiful scenic places ."

Most times on sports teams coaches would tell us to give them our parents email so they can give them the schedule and tell them when they have to serve on the team . I always gave them my email because I felt my mom was always busy with everything else that she would forget about it and so since my team was important to me I decided I would just take care of it because then i knew for a fact it would get done .	"I am hard to get to know . It takes awhile for me to be real with people and tell them my feelings . I don't like feeling vulnerable . Also , i'm a people pleaser so even if something is inconvenient to me , I'll still do it so that I can help release stress from my friend even though i end up being the one stressed ."	Lately I have realized I am disconnected with people . I feel uncomfortable in situations where i shouldn't because I don't like sharing my feelings or placing my pain or duties on others .

I love to have fun and make last minute plans to do fun things . I care a lot about my family and friends .	I like to hang out with my friends . I also like to watch Netflix and read . I also like to hangout outside .	I love	I like Shameless because the scenarios are kind of outlandish an fast paced which is fun to watch . I like the Notebook not only because it lets me have a good cry but also because I love watching the relationship between the main characters that hopefully one day my husband and I will emulate .	My all time favorite book is probably the Handmaid's Tale .	I love it because it uses pretty extreme conditions to relate to our current society on a less intense scale . The book really just makes you think and explore how you feel about certain issues and i really enjoy that .	My dad and sister read it and recommended it to me when i was in 9th grade . I've read it a time or two since then .	"I would love to live in San Diego ! i was raised near a beach so I love being in the vicinity of one all the time , I also love the personality of California in that the people are really laid back and open minded . I also love how diverse and cultured that area is ."	"Exploring . I want to see all the sights , taste all the food , and meet all the people . I'm a very curious person especially wen it comes to traveling , so i'll do anything and everything to satisfy that curiosity ."	"I believe in white lies . If a person is rally better off never knowing the truth about a minor issue then i believe lying , or avoiding the truth , is more beneficial than being truthful ."	I bit my nails . sometimes it gets pretty bad if i'm more stressed or upset .	I'm really passionate about flying planes . My major is Pro . Flight which basically means that i'm learning to become a pilot for an airline one day . I'm happiest when I fly !	"My uncle took my flying in a small plane , a cessna-172 , when I was 15 . Before then i had never considered flying a plane much less making a career out of it . However , after wwe landed I couldn't wait till the next time I could be in a plane ."	"I am a Professional Flight Management major at one of the best aviation programs in the country . I spend almost every moment of my life talking about , looking at , or flying planes . I network a lot so that one day i'll be ale to fly for the airline of my choosing ."	I would love to be a captain for Delta . That's a long way down the road even after college but everything I do from no until then is to reach that goal .	"I love that its not a desk job , I could never see myself doing a "" paper pushing "" type of job . I also love that it involves a ton of travelling , I've always wanted to see the world and now I get to do it for free . It also doesn't hurt that pilots make rather large six figure incomes ."	"I am doing very well , my flight instructors are very complimentary . Everyday I am getting better and better at it and that is very encouraging ."	My favorite course other than aviation is psychology .	"I did very well , I got an A , Now I minor in psychology ."	My favorite professors are my flight instructors . They're not necessarily professors but they teach me how to fly planes . I relate to them a lot and they provide a lot of insight and guidance .	They have been where I am . In fact avast majority of them went through the same program that I am in now . I can go to them with any question within the aviation realm and they will have an answer . That make them pretty valuable to me .	I love	"Honestly , sometimes I think kids have a better outlook on life and people than most adults do . So I really like to talk to them and play with them . A lot of times they say things that really make you think ."	I would probably spend it on my mom .	I would buy her whatever she wanted . She does a lot for me so she deserves anything she wants .	She's been through a lot recently and she's always there for me anyway . She is the person that holds my family together and is totally selfless about it . She would deserve it more than anyone else I know .	My best friends are my siblings .	They are funny and smart and driven . They love me unconditionally and would do anything to see me be happy and vice versa . They are understanding and they listen to my problems even if I talk about them for hours .	They understand me better than anyone else in the entire world . They love me despite my flaws and they stand by my through everything . We've been through a lot together and it's made our bond stronger than any other i've ever made .	I prefer to be a leader . I'm uneasy when I'm not in control .	I would choose partners that are laid back and conscience of others . I would also choose people who are driven and intelligent . They would also need to be flexible and willing to do the work needed .	"They would probably say that I am outgoing and fun , but I can also be subdued if I need to be . They would say that I care about others , especially my friends . They would also say that I am easy to get along with ."	"If i'm upset people tend to mention them . Also when i'm not listening , i'll hear about what people have said about me later on ."	I can be impulsive and rash . I get angry easily about certain things . I can be unmotivated and lazy at times .	"When i'm being lazy my family will tell me . When I do something impulsive , like deciding to get a puppy , everyone told me that it was a bad idea and that I hadn't thought it through ."	I think that I am very tender hearted . I don't like to see people suffer and I will do almost anything to ease someones suffering .	"I can't always let things go , instead ill get angry ."

"I liked it cause I enjoyed being around kids who are different , and I liked making them feel special and reminding them how special and important they are ."	I would spend it on my sister . Because she is one of the sweetest people and I feel like it is something that she would deserve .	I would buy her some clothes and jewlery	I chose her because I love her so much and she means alot to me . She would be very deserving of that and she loves clothes and jewlery .	My best friend is Miracle Scott .	"She is funny , pretty , kind . She is very thoughtful and God-fearing . She is someone that you can turn too , because she will always be there for you no matter what ."	She is my best friend because we have so much fun together . There is never a dull moment when around her and she is someone that I can always count on .	"I prefer to just be a regular teammate . I do not like holding leadership roles , because I do not believe that I am a leader ."	"I would have one person who is a leader and likes to be in charge of things . I would also like someone who was the peacemaker , so whenever there was a problem , they could be the one to help solve it , and then I would like a team clown that would keep everyone laughing ."	"They would probably say that I am very humble , goal-oriented , and determined . I rarely take no for an answer and I always find another route to go to get to my path if I need to ."	"When I was trying to get my ACT so i could attend the college I wanted to , an old friend of mien told me how much of a strong person I was and how much determination I had and that is whats he loved so much about me . She said whenever I am down I always find a way to pick myself back up and move forward like nothing ever happened ."	Some might say that I am pessimistic and I often talk negatively and don't look on the bright side and fear the worse .	"When it comes to my school work , I often feel like I am going to fail and I give up and do not want to keep moving forward because I believe that there is no point ."	"I do not like failure , I like to succeed . I always try to do what it takes to reach my goal , no matter what the situation may be . I try to keep my head and keep moving forward ."	My biggest weakness is trying to stay positive . I struggle with looking on the bright side and keeping my faith . \	My greatest talent I think would be my flag . I was on flagline line for four years in high school and I believe that I am really good at it .

I'm shy until you get to know me . I tend to stick to myself unless I'm super comfortable in the situation . I like to draw and do other crafty things ."	I like to hang out with my friends or sit and watch T . V .	I tend to like	"It keeps you on your toes , you never know what is going to happen next ."	My all time favourite book is the Phantom Tollbooth	It is a cute and whimsical book but it also teaches you lessons .	My mom use to read it to me when I was little .	IF i could live anywhere it would be in New Zealand because that place is so rich in nature and culture .	"In my favourite place in the world , I would love to scuba dive or surf in the ocean ."	I picked this number because I try to be straight forward to people . If they ask for my opinion I'm not going to lie just so they feel better because they asked what I thought not for me to just tell them what they want to hear .	I honestly do not remember what you asked me about . It went away too fast and i can't remember the question .	"I am passionate about school , my animals , and helping those in need ."	"My mom influenced me growing up , she was very hardworking and loves helping people and animals ."	My major revolves around making the environment better for both humans and animals .	I hope to be an environmental architect .	I like the creative aspect of the job as well as the impact i can have on the surrounding area to help make it a better place .	I am working really hard in my school work and I keep up to date on the recent trends in the architecture community .	So far my favourite course has been anthropology .	I did very well in that course . I always aced my exams .	My English professor is probably my favourite right now .	He approaches teaching and writing in a totally different way than my past teachers have and it is new and refreshing .	My favourite job would probably be whe ni worked for the SPCA .	I got to take care of animals who have never been taken care of before and help them get adopted to their forever homes .	I would spend it on my mom .	I would buy her and really nice spa day and her favourite peruse that is too expensive for her to buy normally .	"I chose my mom because she has done so much for me and she works so hard , that she deserves a day where she is pampered ."	My best friend is Anna .	Anna is perfect ! She is super sweet and nice . She genuinely cares for people and she is just great to be around .	She just gets me on a different level than most people do .	On my soccer team I was captain so I would say I prefer to be a leader .	I would chose people that work well with others . They would have to be able to communicate well . They would also have to be very goal focused .	I think most people will say that I'm very open and understanding .	People tend to come to me when they have problems because I will listen with no judgement and help the m figure out what to do .	Probably that i tend to second guess myself .	I will be in a situation and think that I know what is the best way to handle things then someone or something will happen that will make me rethink what i was originally thinking .	I adapt very well to changing surround ings .	I tend to be in relationships that are bad for me and i let them use me and when they are done with and get rid of me i think that it is my fault .	I can get anyone to open up to me .

I currently am a freshman at Auburn University majoring in Pre-Pharmacy . I enjoy swimming competitively and I often go to the gym to work out . I make sure that I always try my very best at everything that I do ."	I enjoy going to the gym usually with a friend or i like to swim at the aquatic center .	My favorite movie is Forrest Gump	I enjoy the movie because it is about the life of a man who beliefs who sees the world differently from others . He thinks that there is a little good in everyone and he is often unaware of the bad things that people do . The movie also stars Tom Hanks and it takes place in Alabama .	My favorite book would probably be all of the books in the Harry Potter series	It is my favorite because I grew up with Harry Potter and I always anticipated the release of a new book .	"The book series was very popular when I was growing up so i heard about it from friends , family , and advertising ."	I would live in a moderately big city . The personality of this place would be somewhat lively and peaceful .	I would enjoy spending time with my family or taking trips to explore parts of the city where people are and parts where people are not such as in the mountains	I never tell lies even if it is for the best because of how it makes me feel . I think that it is morally wrong and it can sometimes create a more negative outcome .	I don't think I have awful habits because I think that I am able to take care of myself . I was raised to do the right thing and I know what I should avoid . I also think about the outcomes of what I am about to do usually .	"I am passionate about Chemistry . When I was in High School , I excelled in my Chemistry classes and today it has impacted the choice that I have made . I decided to major in something that involves going the pre-helth route because I know it involves a lot of chemistry . i am also passionate about swimming . I began swimming when I was six years old and i have not stopped since . Today , I coach children and teach them how to swim because I hope they will enjoy it as much as i do ."	"These passions started because they were both things that I had to work hard for . After working hard in both of these things , the achievement that I earned made me feel good about myself ."	I have gone to Auburn University to further pursue my education in hopes that I will be able to help others . My interest in Chemistry and my experience in coaching has helped me .	Doctor	I am attracted to the fact that I will be able to get to know people and make impacts in their lives .

He usually cheers me up and he is very good at making plans . We also enjoy doing a lot of the same things . We both enjoy going to the gym , talking about swimming / water polo , and sports ."	He is my best friend because he is entertaining to be around . We both share similar hobbies and we are in to the same things .	I prefer to play the role of a team player .	I would choose people who are not greedy in their actions . This means that they are willing to support others while we are playing together and while we are not playing together .	"They would say that I am calm , quiet , a hard-worker , and a rule follower ."	The situation was that I am always someone who will do what is right . I can not currently think of a specific moment in time right now but I think they would agree that I am always there for others .	"People might say that I have a tendency to complain about things , I do not talk enough , and I am indecisive sometimes ."	I think they would say these things because sometimes I am not very interactive with them enough and i have trouble deciding what I want to do .

"I think I want to work in an office space , and I like the idea of being around people and helping keep the peace ."	I'm doing alright I'm interested to see what the classes I need to take will be like .	So far my favorite course would be psychology .	"I'm doing alright . Not my best . I got sick at the beginning of the semester , but I'm doing much better now"	"Dr . Gitter , my psych teacher"	He really tries to make his lecture interesting and makes plenty of analogies so that everyone understands the topics . He also can be pretty funny .	I am a swim coach during the summer and it is by far one of my favorite things I get to do .	I get to work with kids while being involved in a sport while being outside in the sun and in the water . It's a combination of all my favorite things .	My brother .	"My brother has always been a big kid , but know he just turned 16 and is 6'5 and his growth plates are still open . He wears a size 15 shoe and finding affordable clothes from him is always hard , so I would buy him clothes and shoes ."	"My brother is my best friend and I would do anything for him , so I would gladly buy him new clothes and shoes ."	"Besides my brother , it's a girl named Sarah ."	Sarah is a year younger than me in grade but only a few months in age . She's hilarious and can always make me laugh . She listens to great music . She has a wonderful heart and cares so deeply for the people she loves . She is also the most trustworthy person I know . I can tell her absolutely anything and I know it would never spread .	"We met at church and got super close on a mission trip over spring break one year . Then I realized she went to my school , was into the same things as me , and only lived 2 minutes away . We fit together like a puzzle , it's like she was meant for me ."	I like to be the one who calls the shots or assigns the positions on a team .	"I would want people who would put others before themselves and have a great attitude and work ethic . If one teammate has a bad attitude or starts to slack off , then it spreads and the team can't work together ."	"I'm outgoing , funny , and caring ."	I had my youth pastor send me a thank you note once thanking me for my servant leadership and kind heart . He told me that he was glad he had me to step up and guide my peers even though I wasn't given the title of a student leader .	I procrastinate and can be a bit messy sometimes .	In high school I would always wait until the last minute to do things which would drive my parents crazy .	I don't really care about doing something just because everyone else is . I pride myself in knowing that I march to the beat of my own drum	I can be a little disorganized or all over the place with my thoughts and my work if I don't focus .	I would say that it is a tie between singing and comedy .

My goals are to do the best that I can in life to make others lives even better . I am a university student who is studying architecture . I enjoy the outdoors and am from West Virginia .	I spend my free time hanging out with friends . We will go to a movie or dinner or a state park .	I like	Throughout the whole movie you have to guess at what is going to happen next and why it was able to be set up the way it was . I like having some information to solve difficult problems .	My favorite book ever is Lord of The Flies	It is a story that uses children to portray the deepest and darkest parts of humanity . I believe this makes it more powerful due to the fact that children are seen as innocent in most cases .	I had to read the book for my school . I did not come to appreciate it until much later .	I would want to live in a small Spanish town . There is a lot of emphasis on family and culture being preserved throughout history which I think	"I would like to practice architecture by blending both modern ideas of how buildings should be built , with the century old ideas of what they should look like and be used for ."	If I am in a situation that I absolutely have to tell a lie then I will be willing to . I once had to tell a friend that my mom would not let him come to my birthday party . The real reason was that my friends who were already coming did not want him to be there .	My worst habit may be that I am somewhat unorganized . There is no other huge flaw that I see in myself which could be considered an awful habit .	I am passionate about providing everyone in this country with a chance at a good and decent life .	I have volunteered for a good amount of time and seen too many people with heartbreaking stories about how the odds were stacked against them in all aspects . I want to create a world where it is at least much less common for someone to have to overcome these horrible conditions .	I am going into architecture so that I will be able to start a firm which is made with the sole purpose of bringing back necessities to the small towns that have been overlooked by everyone else and give them what they need . Auburn has a rural program very similar which is why I chose it to learn architecture . I also volunteer weekly with underprivileged children	An architect	The ability to turn an empty space that had nothing in it before and recognizing that potential in a way that is beneficial to those around it .	I am a freshman right now so I have not ventured deep into the path but I did decide on this college because of its focus on architecture . I am taking summer classes and have invested a lot of money into this path .	History	I did pretty well last semester and have an A this semester	My theater professor .	He is very fun when teaching . He moves around the class and interacts with students while still commanding attention and cracking jokes all throughout the lecture .	Being a bus boy in a restaurant .	I got to meet a lot of people and learn stories about those who are just trying to make a living at a small tavern .	My family .	I would buy food and pay for their taxes for as long as the money lasts .	My family is going through a rough patch right now . My dad has to pay a lot for medical bills because he had a brain tumor and he also may be losing his job soon . I want my brother and sister to have the same experiences and adventures that I had access to so if I can help make that a reality I would like to .	My suite mate	He is deeply pious and understanding . He is intelligent and curious but will never try to force anyone into a conversation or to accept his personal beliefs . He is very independent and likes to avoid confrontation .	He is someone that I can talk to about anything and that it feels like he was put into my life for a reason . If I am ever having troubles I know that going to him or asking him for help is an option and he is very good about letting me know if I am in the wrong or doing something right .	"I organize that everyone has a role and is able to have clear , defined ideas of what they are doing . I also settle disputes in groups I am a part of and minimize obstacles that may be turned into more of an issue than they need to be"	I would want everyone to be very good at communicating . I would want one of them to be extremely knowledgeable about what it is we are doing and the other to be very good at organizing these thoughts and putting them together in a way that makes it easy to present .	"I am kind , caring , compassionate , and very willing to help"	I was always the designated driver when my friends went out to parties and I made sure I got everyone home and they would be very admitting of these things both in their drunken state and the morning after .	I talk too much or do not take care of myself	I have been told many times when people are either there for a situation or hear of a situation that I put others happiness or needs above my own and they say that I should take care of myself more .	I am extremely charismatic and truly care about the people I come into contact with by looking for the things that are likable every time I meet a person	I will stay out late at night taking care of others or sacrifice an evening of something that would make me happy to make someone else happy .	I would dance	Male	65.39064207	30.46124249	50.85117679	98.99156765	94.42071837	67.53706105	50.08208609	43.82803193	0.475987308	75.11372018	14.11642205	9.66382174	99.79517022	63.80307005	73.20664847	65.71019236	59.95526317	83.2116362	74.44133299	63.78794704	92.13351905	74.18422743	64.61531179	80.90161165	70.25870257	56.14975192	73.18046579	99.99952085	90.24149941	97.53070169	75.09457936	99.8942685	79.26653416	89.68769995	99.97521277	51.25569743	46.14000149	56.81743581	15.65227819	57.16209654	89.25756308	63.48101359	99.94882603	85.73203544	0.230327091	6.232958271	72.76681061	98.99156765	67.53706105	83.2116362	74.44133299	92.13351905	80.90161165	70.25870257	56.14975192	73.18046579	8.49410238Meagan Edwards	"I am very artistic , sporty , and I enjoy spontaneous adventure .

I think"	"I would also like to adventure around to see everything that it has to offer , such as tourist locations ."	"I would only lie , or maybe just leave out all details , if it were to spare someone's feelings or to avoid getting either myself or someone else in trouble for something that is preventable ."	"I like to think that I make rather reasonable decisions . However , I do have a bad habit of procrastinating ."	"I am passionate about the importance of family . Also , I am passionate about my field of study , architecture ."	I am passionate about family because of the close relationship I have with mine . Both began once I went to college .	"With architecture , I am in a five year program to study the field and eventually work towards beginning my own firm ."	I want to be an architect that can perform both interior and exterior design .	"I think it is interesting how with architecture you are given the opportunity to create something that does not already exist . Basically , I get to take part in changing the world through design ."	"I think I am doing well . I am still only in my first year of study , so it is hard to say so far . I see a path ahead with many possible opportunities that I can take ."	My architecture studio class is my favorite .	"So far , I have done pretty well ."	Margaret Fletcher is my favorite . She is one of two of my studio professors .	"I appreciate the time and effort she puts into teaching the program . She gives very helpful feedback when talking to her one-on-one . Primarily , the fact that she is not always strict and serious . A few icebreaker comments in class are always enjoyable ."	I enjoyed	The opportunity gives me the chance to be around the construction industry and work towards gaining information for architecture and their collaboration with engineers .	I would spend it on my family .	I'd put it towards going on a vacation	"My family is important to me , and we do not get the chance to go on vacations because of how busy everyone is , and we cannot afford to spend the money ."	"I have several : David Hardesty , Isaac Weber , and Wendy Hobdy"	They each are very outgoing and adventurous . Very kindhearted people .	They bring me out of my comfort zone and introduce me to new experiences .	"It really depends on the size of the team and what the task at hand is . I like to lead , but I also will sit back and do what is asked of me ."	"Agreeable people would be on my team , for sure . It is hard to work with someone who does not like to take criticism or advise from others ."	People tell me that I'm funny and they might say that I am a good friend .	"In general , anytime that I hangout with people we have a good time and enjoy each other's company ."	They might say that I am really bad about procrastinating .	"In studio , we will be around each other working on projects and they will witness when I get stressed and avoid work for a while ."

I like to go shopping and go on walks . I also love to ride horses in my spare time when i am home .	I love	I love shameless because in some of the episodes i feel so sorry for the family but in other episodes i envy their courage and ability to get by . It is sad at some times and happy at others which is what i love most about it .	my favorite book is probably fifty shades of grey because of how passionate and well written it is	i love how passionate and well written it is and how the author doesn't care how he portrays people	My mom recommended i read it when i graduated high school	i have always lived and it is where i would like my kids to grow up . It has the beach and it has a downtown . It is a city but not too big and just all around great community	I love going on the boat with my friends or just walking downtown to see all the historical sights .	"I don't think it is necessarily okay to lie however , im only human and know i have done it before . I hate lying to my mom and dad so if I wouldn't lie to them then i shouldn't lie to anyone else . I always try my best to not lie and be honest to everyone ."	I have little habits that I know i need to stop but cant . Such as biting my nails it drives my family and friends insane but i cant stop . Also smacking my gum is another one that drives people insane .	I am passionate about animals and helping people in the medical field .	I started riding horses when i was 3 and that is how my love for animals really started . As for the medical field I just always have felt a little spark when I see people have gotten help from doctors and nurses . it would make me happy if one day i could save a life or help someone myself .	I am applying to nursing school in the fall of 2017 so hopefully if I get into nursing school I can pursue my passion of helping people medically .	I would like to be a nurse either a pediatrics nurse or a trauma nurse .	I love helping people and especially seeing family and friends happy when I help one of their loved ones .	"I am doing okay , the classes are hard and its very stressful but i think at the end of the day it will all pay off ."	So far my favorite course has been psychology	Right now i have a high B in it and hopefully will be able to raise it to an A by the end of the semester .	I have really enjoyed	"I love how understanding he is about the fact that we are college students and we have a life outside of just school work . He doesn't assign too much work where we feel stressed , but just enough where we can grasp the concept ."	My favorite job has been hostessing at a bbq restaurant	It was just very fast pace and there was always something exciting going on	I would spend it on my brothers	I would split it up evenly and buy something that they all love . Maybe a new fishing pole or snowboard or something that they would be able to use	I love my brothers more than anything in the world and would do absolutely anything for them . I would also buy them anything to let them know how much they mean to me everyday . I would purchase them something that they could use because they are very outgoing and adventurous people as well and would really be able to put it to good use .	my best friend is caroline from home	Caroline is very sincere in everything she does . She would never leave me hanging and would be there for me in a heart beat . She is also outgoing and very driven in everything she does .

She is with me constantly when im home and always makes me laugh and do fun things with her .	"I don't like to be the leader , but i don't like to stand in the background and just watch everyone else do the work ."	I would like someone to be on my team who is driven in everything they do not just for the team . I would want someone who is outgoing and easy to talk to as well .	I think they would say im a very fun person who loves to laugh and enjoys life .	I think my friends here at auburn would say that about me because if and when we go to parties i like to make sure everyone is in the best mood possible	I think people will say my worst quality about me is my temper or getting too excited .	I just get aggravated easily sometimes with people when they are ignorant or do something ignorant . I don't necessarily scream and yell but when i get upset or worked up i get very quiet .	there usually isn't a time when im smiling and i believe that because of that im unique in my own way . People have told me before that my smile is contagious and it is the best compliment i have ever recieved .	If someone doesn't want to do something and i believe that it will be fun or beneficial for that person I tend to push people into doing it and sometimes it is a very bad thing .	I would ride horses because i think that is my biggest talent in life that could get me to win	Female	51.07570841	6.650152348	50.49400421	97.17849027	15.03983664	99.52632371	37.56544331	50.41082662	21.54877391	78.89006428	61.88738036	0.447850251	94.22535666	45.46553427	83.13032987	98.60063376	74.80918129	87.00003198	68.09751258	71.33868935	98.93593024	64.96416437	19.20780006	74.20497917	83.72110646	57.69938588	72.93201295	82.01970167	90.75984973	94.65689513	97.19897883	89.04238112	74.68231165	96.25600083	92.72253083	23.0593371	73.14882452	74.16933553	1.061405887	69.53102989	90.25608109	35.67781841	89.60890152	97.56970675	16.29650522	25.26511877	64.1867704	97.17849027	99.52632371	87.00003198	68.09751258	98.93593024	74.20497917	83.72110646	57.69938588	72.93201295	19.54425266Haley Hughes	"Hey !

In college , I have worked with my sorority at raising money and awareness for our philanthropy ."	A Physical Therapist	"I already answered that question , but what I said was , I had a sports related injury in high school that required me to go to physical therapy , and that's when this occupation sparked my interests . I would get to help people every single day overcome their injuries , and help them through their hard time"	I am doing well at staying on track to reach this goal .	History has been my favorite so far	I made a B last semester	"Dr . Bohannan , my history teacher"	"She's just really great at conveying the information so I can understand it , and she is super approachable and not intimidating ."	I enjoyed	"It was just a great experience because I was responsible for this little girl and making sure she got to the places she needed to be on time and safely . It really made me see what it is like having kids , and helped me grow into a more responsible adult ."	My family	Whatever I felt like they really needed or wanted	"Because they have done so much for me , and I want to give back and help them' Because they have done so much for me , and I want to give back and help them"	Elsa Leonard	"She's super fun , and smart . She keeps me laughing and is always down to grab lunch or something . She is a hard worker and passionate about friendships ."	"Because of her trustworthyness , and how accepting she is"	I prefer to be a leader on a team	"I would want to be partners with people who are hardworking and passionate about the sport we are playing . I would want to be around people who won't give up when it gets hard , and will keep the team's best interest in mind"	I think they will say that my best quality is how much I care about others	"I just think that people can see how much I genuinely care about them , and how I would drop anything for them if they needed me ."	Sometimes I don't speak up and voice my opinion	I just get worried about what others might think so I don't speak what is on my mind	"I am very tall so that makes me unique Also , I have a twin sister so that makes me unique !"

I have a huge passion for music and I love to go to concerts . I love sports and going to sporting events . I love to spend time with kids and helping others . I like to please people .	I I love to watch Netflix and listen to music . I also love to go see any type of live music that is around .	Well recently I watched the series 13 Reasons Why and it is one of my favorites right now .	I love how real it is . It portrays high school exactly how it is and how people are . It shows the things that happen that people just don't talk about . It has a very important message .	My all time favorite book would have to be The Perks of Being a Wallflower .	"The book is about a young boy who is starting high school . He is very intelligent and has a hard time making friends . Then he meets a few older kids who take them under their wings and help him with life and answer all of his questions . He ends up falling in love with one of them , so it includes a love story which I really like . On the last page , you find out that when he was a child he was sexually abused by a family member and it just hits you in a way that you were not expecting ."	"The book became a movie . I saw the trailer on tv . I personally will not watch a movie until I have read the book it was based on first . I like to see how it was actually meant to be , and not how Hollywood portrays it ."	I haven't had the chance to travel outside of the country . I think	I would enjoy going to listen to live music every night . They have live music playing at all types of venues 7 days a week . I would love the atmosphere of the big city and the cultural diversity that they have there .	"I have a hard time with confrontation .

I spend a lot of time with my family watching movies , tv shows , and going to concerts . We love to see live music together and we do it very often ."	I want to be an Occupational Therapist .	The job allows me to be around people all day . I want to talk to people and get to know them and help them with their therapy . i love that I will be doing something all day and that I won't just be sitting at a desk all the tiem .	"I am doing great . I will graduate with my undergraduate degree in 4 short months . I will then get a temporary job that will allow me to gain experience in this field , before attending Occupational Therapy school ."	My favorite courses have been my ethics classes . They really make you think .	I received an A .	My favorite professor was the teacher of the ethics class I was in .	"My professor really challenged me to understand the material , without making me sacrifice my beliefs . She wanted to make sure that we really understood the material before moving on to the next thing . Her tests were not hard , but it was because we were taught so well ."	I work as a supervisor at the on campus recreation and wellness center and I love	I love the people I work with and the atmosphere . I love that I get to have a daily impact on other students when they walk into the gym . I love being a supervisor that works along side her employees rather than looking down on them .	My mom	I would buy her a vacation to a tropical island that includes a spa that she could be pampered in .	She is the best thing that I have in this world . She loves me unconditionally and is always there for me . She is willing to do anything for me .	My best friend is named Michael .	He is great ! He is an awesome listener and he is very protective of me . He is pretty much my brother from another mother . I have known him for so long and I feel comfortable around him .	We have grown up together and we always had classes together . So we hung out a lot and we just tell each other things that we don't tell other people . We tell each other the truth even when we don't want to hear it .	"I love to be on a team ! I have played sports my whole life . I prefer to be one of the leaders . I like to be in charge , but also lead by example ."	I would want hard workers . I want people on my team who want what is best for the team and who want to see the team be successful . I do not want people who will hold us back . A team is only as strong as its weakest player .	I think that they will say that I am very organized and that I always have a plan . I think that they will say that I am a good friend who is loyal . They will probably say that I am outgoing and like to talk a lot .	"Recently , some friends and I went on a road trip to New York City . Prior to the trip , I made an itinerary and planned everything out so that we could make the most of our time there ."	People will say that I worry too much or that sometimes I need to relax	I get worked up about things not going the way I want them to . I am now learning that everything does not work out how you planned and I have gotten better about it .	I think that I am very mature for my age and that makes me unique . I had to grow up at an early age due to having so many younger siblings . I also think I have a very unique quality with people . I can talk to anyone and make friends easily .	I accept too many responsibilities when I don't have the time I just want to help	I can sing	Female	60.60479867	24.47200007	86.01531441	99.54994322	41.59429985	36.01088803	75.98634644	47.12539042	42.2284935	83.13431739	19.76228035	2.003404003	96.47263725	39.15121003	66.74987488	48.39962437	52.21569792	80.2662785	81.76849178	43.33509117	94.51406552	75.18369367	98.99601393	97.40885117	69.77125964	57.18186644	58.68896292	69.05520792	84.17749477	86.2330462	71.90836049	72.82920158	99.58164999	85.38789729	89.1248131	48.47247757	48.22403609	83.41216494	3.428521664	85.25729339	74.59977862	87.40556667	99.46599241	89.9025524	5.446188766	18.35901694	63.06287261	99.54994322	36.01088803	80.2662785	81.76849178	94.51406552	97.40885117	69.77125964	57.18186644	58.68896292	27.04759976Robert Kelley	I am a very calm and positive person .

I am always happy and laughing , normally smiling and laughing . I love to be outside and active , and I rarely like to be alone . I love activities and adventure . I get my energy from being around other people ."	"I spend my free time outside , usually walking with friends or going to dinner and sitting outside ."	I have a ton of trouble ever picking a favorite in my life . I rarely watch tv or movies . I do really like	I love the way it makes me feel emotionally . I feel like I am in the characters shoes .	I can continuously read . I do love	"I love the Nightingale because it not only was about history , and I learned a lot , but also because it had romance in it"	My mom recommended it to me .	I think	There is a beach right outside of Savannah that I love called Tybee .	I will sometimes tell a white lie if I know that it is better for the situation . I would rather not hurt someone if I know that they do not really need to know something .	"I have a bad habit of picking at my nails , forgetting my laundry in the dryer for multiple days , or forgetting to text people back for days or weeks ."	"I am passionate about people and relationships . I love to see people happy , and to know about their lives ."	This passion started from probably socializing with a lot of people in high school who weren't necessarily in my friend group	"I try to constantly reach out to people and encourage them when they have a lot going on , just to let them know I am thinking and praying for them"	I am going to be an Interior Designer in a Firm that designs homes and restaurants .	"Working with people , creating spaces for people to live in that represent them and what is important to them , and the challenge of the job ."	"I am doing well , I have already set up an internship to work for my dream company to pursue my goals ."	My interior design studio classes	I have received all As / I have received all As .	My favorite professor in college would probably Melanie Duffey .	"I have never learned more in a class than I did when I took her class . She challenged me , and the class was the hardest class I've ever taken , but what I walked out of the class with was so much better ."	I loved	"I loved this job because I got to know the family , they trusted me , and treated me so well ."	I would spend that money on my grandma .	"I think I would buy her a much needed vacation , if she were able to travel ."	"I would chose her because she is not doing very well , and I want to see her happy again . I think a vacation with her grand kids or family would mean the most to her ."	My best friend is Whitcomb .	"My best friend is one of the hardest workers I know . He is also one of the most grounded people I know and has the strongest faith that is constantly making me a better person . He also makes me laugh so hard , and says so many funny phrases you've never heard of . I learn so much every time I am around him ."	"He is always talking to me , visiting me , and checking in how my day is and thinking of me"	I prefer to be the leader in a team situtation	"My ideal partners would be very hardworking , but still have grounded morals making them trustworthy . These people would also be a joy for me to be around , making team work more fun and easy ."	The people who know me would probably say my thoughtfulness and how dependable I am . They would also say how I am funny and fun to be around .	My friends wrote me notes on random occasions and have said these things .	My worst qualities are that I hate confrontation and would avoid it at all costs .	"If someone ever has a problem with me or something I've done or said , when they say I need to talk to you "" I immediately panic and get nervous . I also rarely will tell someone if I have a problem with them ."	"I believe I have a unique way of making people I've just met comfortable , or leaving a good impression on someone . I also have a unique way with children , and am constantly surrounded by younger kids who look up to me and want me to be in their lives ."

I care about deeply about others but do not often accurately represent to them that i care . It takes a lot for me to become stressed but when i do i stay stressed for days at a time . I feel my emotions deeply and they play an important role in how i act during the day .	"I like to watch anime , ice skate , and be with friends ."	My favorite Tv show is Rick and Morty because they use witty and very dry humor which matches my humor and makes me laugh every time i watch it .	I love that most of the episodes seem to be non-scripted and the creators are just having fun . I like that none of the episodes get boring and i can re-watch them multiple of times .	My favorite book is The Mortal Instruments and The Infernal Devices .	"I enjoy the sci-fi , fantasy story-line with mythological undertones that also mixes with romance between characters I prefer ."	These books were suggested to my by my close friend when we were in high school .	I would love to live in Australia . The personality of Australia seems to be warm and laid back but slightly dangerous . It appears to be a place open and inviting to outsiders .	"I would love to become a wicked surfer and just surf all day , soak in the sun on the warm beach , and only take breaks to swim or eat . Id also love to travel throughout the beautiful cities in Australia and learn their accent ."	I think lying can be useful as long as no one gets hurt and you only use it for good reasons . . If i knew something that would hurt another person or a friend and would not benefit them at all i would lie to them if they asked me about it . I would also lie if someone asked me something about myself that i would not want them to know .	I have bad habits of letting myself become distracted and not studying or completing course work when i should be . I have poor discipline when it comes to school lately . I also have a bad habit of forgiving people that have hurt me and do not deserve to be forgiven .	I am passionate about animals including their safety and rights . I believe animals should never be treated inhumanely .	"It started as a kid , growing up we always had animals of all sorts and just growing with them showed me they are closer to use emotional wise than many people think ."	"I am not pursuing this passion with school but i hope to make enough money with my degree to be able to help support animal shelters and other animal right organizations , and give homes to many animals myself ."	I want to be a computer programmer that can eventually work from anywhere not just in an office everyday .	The money and connections that can be made in this profession is very appealing to me and the fact that i can program from anywhere with internet on the planet means i can travel until to my hearts content .	I am doing decently well . I have had trouble emotionally and stress wise dealing with some aspects of college but am beginning to get the hang of it and fully understand my potential and limitations .	My favorite course in college so far has to be my World History I course .	So far i have a B in the course but will have an A by then end of the semester .	"My favorite professor in college is Mr . Bryan Williams , my English composition I teacher ."	Mr . Williams is very kind and genuinely interested in every paper your write . He is always open to guide and give feedback to any of his students . He is also very handsome which helps .	My favorite job has to be when i worked at a dog grooming salon .	I enjoyed that job because i was surrounded by dogs which love to give dog kisses all day long . I would bathe the dogs and they just made the job stress free and fun to do .	I would spend it on my mother	I would buy my mom anything she wanted which would probably be to get her nails done and then spend the rest on bills	I chose that person because she is the most important thing in the world to me . I chose that purchase because it is what she would want me to spend it on and i want her to be happy	My bestfriend is kayley watson	Kayley is very smart and witty . She can be so kind and would do anything within her power to help you if you asked her to . She can sometimes have a sharp tongue and be passive aggressive bu that is only when she is stressed out or angry . She rarely ever gets angry and if she does it is never for long .	We met in kindergarten where we bonded and have been inseparable since . We know every possible thing about each other . We have very similar personality traits which connects us .	I usually end up being the leader of the group even though i do not enjoy it .	My ideal partners would be people who could cooperate with each other and become a team . I would choose people who had knowledge of the subject we needed the team for . I would choose people who could listen and give ideas rather than piggy back on others .	"I think they will say i'm kind , light-hearted , and rarely get angry ."	At work when people ask my friends if im angry at them they usually respond with no because they know i never get mad but just come off as cold sometimes .	"I can be cold , distant , and become mean when angry or irritated ."	Whenever i get upset i push people away or say things i don't really mean which lead them to say those things about me .	"I dont believe i have a purely unique quality , other than be insistent need to forgive others ."	I try to study and do work i know i need to do but i am unable to sit down and make myself concentrate .	My greatest talent would have to be my ice skating but i am not very good at it .

It is hard for me really excited or really upset , especially around other people . I do love to be around people , however , only in small groups and not for long periods of time ."	"I enjoy reading , watching shows and movies on Netflix , and going out with friends ."	I like	Conceptually Sense8 is just more original than anything I have seen in a long time . It also addresses so many issue across different cultures . Plus there is an appropriate amount of romance .	The name of the book is Margaretowne	One reason is that my bestfriend gave it to me and told me how much he loved it . It tells the story a 5 women of varying ages yet they all possess the same name and live in the same house . They are actually one women throughout her life . A man has fallen in love with a younger one and she brings him home to meet the others and he loves each one a little bit for different reasons .	A friend suggested it .	I like it because it has a real winter but also an actual summer . And its busy but it has its quiet places .	"Honestly , I am pretty lame , my favorite part of most trips I take is staying and relaxing in the hotel room . However , if the city has a great zoo or aquarium I will have fun doing that ."	"I rarely feel the need to lie , even if it is to spare feelings . I may word something nicer than it occurs to say it in my head but I make the same point known . Also to say I do not lie is not accurate therefore I chose 2 ."	Some things I do often I am not the most proud of or think that I should quit .	"I never know what to say to this question . I am passionate about community , whether it be big or small . I like to have a close group of friends and know them intimately . Also when people in my major all know each other and hang out or volunteer together ."	"This is how my dad is when it comes to keeping our family connected , I suppose I am just applying this to other aspects of my life . I grew up around a lot of tradition and ritual and I like to be around people who want that or at least go along with it ."	"I do my best to really , truly get to know people in my inner circle . I am very observant and make many attempts to relate and / or plan events that bring us together ."	I want to get my graduate degree in laboratory science and either work in lab science to save money for a small business or go to law school and still do the same .	"I enjoy that I am currently learning to do exactly what I could potentially be doing . The job is very ritualistic , everything has a process , which eliminates any confusion or the possibility for mistakes ."	I started on a different path that was not for me and I was ignoring what I WANTED to be doing . This job could combine thing abilities I have academically and give me the opportunity to pursue a dream .	I enjoy	I received a B in Microeconomics and am currently enrolled in Managment .	John Sophocles	"He would let us settle for being mediocre , he constantly reminded us that we were in college and that the bar for expectations had been risen . Sophocles asked questions about what we thought and waited for us to answer . Most engaging class I have had in a while ."	Working at the university bookstore .	"It was laid back . I did not have managers micromanaging me ! They told me what to do and how to do it , if I had questions I could ask ."	My mom .	Probably a new wardrobe .	It is the one thing she will never buy for herself yet always complains that she needs . I think she deserves to be treated .	Austin	"She is extremely bubbly , gives her time to anyone who asks and is more affectionate than any other human I know . We are complete opposites"	"We just have a chemistry , we enjoy the same things and take the time to get to know each other and make one another happy ."	I suppose I like to be the leader . Only because I like to know what the final product us and have the ultimate decision on input .	"I would like to have teammates who are similar to me . We must similar work ethic , commitment , and intelligence ."	"Outgoing , observant , and easy-going"	Once my friend was asked on facebook who her most observant friend was and she tagged me . I had not given it much thought before then .	Emotionally detached	Often times my friends will not call me when they are upset but tell me after because they know I will not be the most comforting person to talk to . It has also happened that a friend will call and later tell me I was awkward yet comforting in my own strange way .	"I am able to relate to many different types of people . They can be a different race , gender , sexual orientation , nationality , etc ."	"They find it hard to get to know me , I am not very open to others ."	Oratory .

I enjoy my major because it is more hands on instead of studying textbooks . I would say that I am a creative person with many different ideas . I am fun and happy most of the time . I am also soft hearted and gentle , caring a lot about people and animals around me . I am more on the outgoing side and love interacting with people ."	"I like to take naps , read books , play volleyball , or hang out with friends ."	I personally love	"Well it is very dramatic and has a lot of different twists and turns so I can never predict what is going to happen . There is also some romance in there that keeps it interesting . I would say it is a good series full of action , drama , and romance ."	The Host by Stephanie Meyor	I just remember reading it and wishing that it would never end . It was just a good work of fiction that was kind of unrealistic so it was cool to read about stuff that I am not used to experiencing .	Well I read the Twilight series which is written by the same author . I loved her works so much that I wanted to see what else she had written . And that is how I discovered it .	I guess	i would love to learn to surf in Austrailia	"I usually do not lie but will if I have to . For example , if someone confides in me about something and I promise to not mention it to anyone .

I was raised in church and so from a young age I have just always been taught about God and the bible and I am thankful for that because it has paved the path to where i am today . When i came to college i had to decide if this was something that I was passionate about or if it was just something I was raised to care about . But deep down it is something that I believe in and care about and center my life around . Stemming from that is my love for others .	Well I intern at a local church and serve there as well . As far as my passion for interior design I am in school right now to get a degree in it so that i can get jobs doing that one day .	"An interior designer , a wife , and a mom ."	I like being given projects or assignments based on people's needs and wants . I like the idea of getting to express my creativity and impress other people by accomplishing there requests .

I love music and photography , started my own business three years ago . I also like to get things done at a steady pace !"	"I like to clean my apartment and get homework / studying done . I also like working on pictures and editing them . And also I like playing with my puppy , her name is Ginny !"	I enjoy	I like being the one who can figure it out before anyone else can !	I love	The creativity it took to create those is outstanding !	I found it on my own when I was in elementary school . We had to take tests on them and I usually chose heavy readings to take test on .	I would love to either live at the beach or in Europe ! The beach is just a calm and relaxing place where you can go and enjoy natures beauty . Europe is full of amazing art that I would love to see !	The beach I would love to learn how to surf ; it looks so graceful but yet it takes a lot of strength and skill to do . In Europe I would go around and look and appreciate art all day long .	"Sometimes I believe certain situations deserve a lie . One thing I could think of is if I knew my mom had a very important day coming up , I wouldn't tell her bad news in order to let her not be upset on her important day . I would wait until after when it would be appropriate . I believe it is all about timing the situation right ."	"I would say that procrastination is a pretty awful habit but sometimes it happens to me . An example would be going to the gym , I know that I need to go but I try to put it off for as long as I can ."	Photography and my religious beliefs are my biggest passions !	Photography had always been an interest of mine because I love creative and art activities . I got my first camera as a graduation present and it as been amazing history from there . My family has also always been involved in church and I love spreading the word of God and seeing what impact He has on other people's lives !	I started my own business about three years ago and am now going to school for it so I can hopefully one day own my personal business . I have been involved with Student Government Association and the Glomerata team for photography through school . For Church I worked through the church for seven years and now have been asked to do photography for them !	"I would like to manage a business and get experience from that , then eventually build my own business of photography and be labeled as "" professional "" !"	Being able to make the right decisions in the best interests for the company and the employees .	I believe that I am doing well on my path so far . Once I am able to get experience outside of college I think that will build me even further .	So far my favorite has been Economics . It is a difficult class to understand but I have been able to do decently well in the class compared to other students .	Right now I have a C average in the course .	"My favorite professor in college was actually at Auburn University of Montgomery , her name is Mrs . Alice ."	"She was great at teaching art . She taught us how to use the materials and different techniques we could do with them . Instead of grading us on the over all look of our projects , she graded us on how we used the materials and skills she taught us to use . I really appreciated that ."	"The one that I am currently at , I am a salesperson at Auburn Art ."	"The management is great to work for , and I get to learn a lot of different skills through this job ."	I would send it on my mom . She has done so much for me .	I would honestly just give it to her . She didn't have anything to help start me in college but anytime she can help she does . I would just repay her for everything she's done !	"She has helped me as much as she could , and she doesn't really need anything other than financial help ."	Adrienne White	"She is the complete opposite of me . She is loud and crazy and doesn't understand much , when I only talk if I need to and very easy going . We have been best friends since 7th grade ."	"I can tell her anything . Even if we are miles apart and even if we didn't see each other for a long time , everything is the same and amazing when we are together ."	I like being the leader and being able to organize how the team should complete tasks .	My ideal partners would be people who have a positive attitude in everything that they do . Also people who can efficiently get the task done .	"They would say that I am very strong in everything that I do . Even though I can get stressed out at times and thing become overwhelming , I still push through and do what I need to do ."	"When I have had to deal with rude and difficult customers , I have had my boss tell me that I handled the situation well ."	The worst would be that sometimes when the stress is too much that I break down . I have gone through periods in my life before where things were too much to handle so I kept to myself for a long time .	"One time when I had lost my second job , made bad grades , and was going through relationship problems all at once , I did not talk to anyone for almost three weeks ."	"I am creative in everything that I do . Also even if I don't want to , I can make myself and everyone else feel comfortable in any situation ."	"School work never actually interests me so I don't start it right away . And I put everyone else's feeling before mine , even when it could hurt mine the most ; as in pleasing a boyfriend when I don't agree with it ."	"Art , that would definitely be my strongest talent . I draw detailed portraits and that is a skill I believe not many people contain ."

I am an emotional person and many of my decisions are determined by my emotions ,"	"Going to the gym , watching netflix , going out to eat with friends , photography , playing sports , being social with friends"	My favorite TV show is Scandal	Its very dramatic and has a lot of twists and terms as well as action scenes and romantic scenes	A Tale of Two Cities	I like the historical aspect of the book as well as the interweaving of plot lines that connects the lives of multiple characters of different backgrouds .	I actually read it in a high school literature course	I would want to live in California .

I love trying new things and foods as well as relaxing by the ocean and enjoying the breeze and the sun .	"For certain situations , I believe that lying is acceptable to protect someone . I don't condone lying for your own benefit or to hide the truth from someone to avoid consequences , but in some situations lying could be more beneficial than the truth ."

My boyfriend	I would probably pay for that person to go somewhere	He has been my best friend for forever and has a huge impact on my life . He loves golf and the masters so I would probably pay for him to play at Augusta national because he gave up going to the masters this year to be my date to a formal so I would want to be able to give that experience back to him in some way .

I can trust them with anything and they are always willing to drop everything to be there if i need something or need to talk	Our personalities click together really well and we seemed to have a natural connection that brought us together and made us so close .	My favorite role has been being a co-captain . I like to lead and be an example but I do not like having that much responsibility on myself so it was nice to have someone else to also be sharing that responsibility .	i would want people who enjoy the sport or activity as much as I do who will want to come out and play every day . I like competitive people who want to win as well as compassionate people who will always be willing to go the extra mile for another teammate .	"They would probably say that I am a hard worker who cares a lot about other people , that I am funny and fun , but I also am emotional and have a lot of different moods ."	A lot of times it just in conversation between friends when they say something that they have observed or liked about me .	I can be mean and moody . i dont make decisions well and have trouble being spontaneous and straying from a plan . i also feel guilt pretty extremely so I dont like to break the rules or be sneaky very often when it comes to certain things	These are just some things that people have observed about me and shared or things that I feel are a detriment to me	I think I have a unique sense of humor as well as the way I think about things and situations .	I care a lot about what people think of me and their critiques of myself and my work which means that some things become personal for me .	I guess I could sing . . . I dont really have that many talents I could use in a talent show .

But there is always a cute puppy coming in to make up for all the stress	I would probably spend it on my parents . They have done so much for me and they deserve something in return	I would probably buy them a vacation or something that they needed help with financially . Whichever they needed at the time	"Because my parents have spent so much money on me before I was born . They deserve to get something back from me besides a thank you . I chose a vacation because they are always working or going 100 mph , it would be nice for them to get away and relax"	"tough one . . . I have a couple best friends . Halle , Abby and my mom"	Halle is very outgoing and quick on her feet . She never fails to make me laugh and challenge me to be a better person .

Someone who is willing to give it there all no matter what and it willing to take constructive criticism because everyone can improve .

I think my best qualities are my organizational skills . I am always on top of everything and plan out my day . I like to have a set goal . I also think I am personable . I don't like having shallow conversations with people and I think this makes it easier to connect to others if I wish to .

"For example , sometimes people need reassurance more than they need the truth for the time being .

I also have a hard time balancing how much time I spend doing things .	I am the most passionate about helping people in need .	I think I've always been this way .

He also cares more about how well we understand the material than trying to trick us or make the class hard . He also takes the time to thoroughly answer any questions anyone has . He's very friendly as well .	My favorite would have to be working as a pre-school age gymnastics teacher .	I love working with children and it was a really fun class to teach . We got to do all four events in gymnastics with them even though they were so young and it was really rewarding to see how much they grew and improved throughout their semester with me .	That's a tough one . Definitely either my parents or my nephews . I wouldn't be able to choose just one .	Even though it wouldn't go very far probably towards a vacation for my parents . That could probably pay for their flights .	They do everything for me and have worked incredibly hard to provide for me and my family and they don't get enough time for themselves .	"Right now , probably my sorority little , Ashley ."	She is extremely outgoing and everyone always has fun with her . She is very head strong and stands up for what she doesn't agree with and doesn't like . She is also sweet and caring to those she loves .	"She is very similar to me .

"It depends , if I feel like I'm the most competent in whatever we are doing then I have no problem taking on a leadership role . I often don't feel like I am most competent and prefer to let others make the plan and then I work really hard to do my part in it ."	"I would prefer people who work hard and are relatively easy going and independent . Even if someone is better at a certain skill , I would prefer someone with a better attitude with less skill ."	Probably that I am kind or caring and try to keep a positive attitude .	"Not really , one example I guess from last weekend was I put together a really cute gift basket for Ashley for her last formal to surprise her with and she was very appreciative when she looked through it this morning ."	That I am not really motivated in school and avoid it a lot of times and that sometimes I prefer to be alone for long periods of time and that offends my friends .	"Last year , I lived with my two best friends for the 3rd year in a row and I went through a phase where I was very depressed and instead of opening up to them they felt that I pushed them away for no reason and still feel that way because I still haven't explained why ."

I am a freshman at Auburn University . I am excited for summer ! I love dogs and the outdoors !	I spend my free time outside with my dog . We go on walks or to the park .	I love	I like to see the inside of celebrities lives .	Kisses from Katie is my favorite book !	I like the book because it is about an 18 year old girl who completely sacrificed her whole life for the Lord and moved to Uganda to love on lost people . She has adopted 13 girls and now has a ministry there called Amazima	I was recommended by a friend	If I could live anywhere it would be Uganda to help build God's kingdom . The people there are so beautiful and have so much joy over things that I take for granted .	I would tell the people of Uganda about Jesus and what He did for them . I would help those in need and bring light back to places that are so dark in their lives	"Because I never tell lies , but I will just not speak on something if it is contradicting ."	I have a bad habit of hanging out with friends and doing other things than studying	I am passionated about Jesus ]	Whenever I realized I was a broken sinner and that He was the only One who could save me and bring redemption in my life	I read the God's word . I go to church . I share my faith with others . I try to serve the Lord in all aspects of my life .	"I want to serve the Lord , in whatever way H e would have me to do that ."	I know that my purpose here on earth is to serve the Lord and share His name . I know how good He is and I want others to know that too	Good . I take it day by day and go where God leads .

She loves Jesus and exemplifies that in the way she lives	Because she loves me for me and never judges my actions	It depends on the type of team . But I typically stay back and go with the flow	"Nice , humorous , and athletic"	"Nice , funny , loves Jesus"	When I was in high school a mom told me that she wanted her daughter to be just like me when she was older and that meant a lot because she was complimenting all of my qualitites	"I am impatient , and a bad driver"	"I drive fast , and like to be on the go all the time"	"I love dogs , and being outside"	My roommate and I got in to a argument and she tries to confront me a lot and I cant stand it	Horse-back riding	Female	55.29440072	0.640568654	53.60555298	80.41378853	27.55643687	99.40455458	70.14550268	53.20598174	28.20876564	70.51313105	56.62317177	32.23465613	100	31.65616585	71.00442315	66.30654536	76.16392792	78.36433194	63.99792117	48.26025424	92.93355827	66.58501159	69.11927858	81.44193905	61.9673905	52.75685706	69.58825082	64.63635352	87.85770181	68.06667117	97.47110651	99.98937224	70.63893649	91.00074025	99.97938418	99.99797626	59.19616603	99.96907146	41.85963404	99.99998962	99.99999992	54.97226075	80.87315417	85.25041597	0.09955762	88.48346635	77.8454351	80.41378853	99.40455458	78.36433194	63.99792117	92.93355827	81.44193905	61.9673905	52.75685706	69.58825082	45.01149717Brigid Hans	i am a fun loving girl who likes to have fun with her friends .

I am studying English Education and Spanish . I am a very hardworking individual . I think the most important attribute in a person is loyalty .	"I spend my free time doing school work , running , and spending time with friends ."	My favorite tv show is That 70's show .	I love the time period its in and because its funny and light hearted .	""" Looking For Alaska "" is my favorite book"	I like to think I identify with the main character in the book or that she is the kind of person i would like to be because she is complex and intelligent and has a good grasp on life and her role in living . It is also realistic and makes you feel certain deep emotions that for someone like me are hard to get to .	My mom gave me the book for Christmas one year	I would live in Spain . I love the language and the culture . It is much more laid back than American culture and it is deeply rooted in tradition .	My major is a double major in English Education and Spanish so that I can teach ESL ( English as a Second Language ) students . Spain ( particularly Barcelona ) would give me the opprotunity to do this in a beautiful country	"I dont like to lie and of course I think lying is wrong but sometimes little white lies are necessary to maintain peoples feelings or maintain peace and order . Like for example , telling my mom that I have already turned something in when I am planning to do it that day maintains the peace and keeps an argument from happening but I dont like to lie often and I keep it to things with little significance"	I dont like feeling prisoner to any habit . I dont like feeling like I have to be dependent on something so if i feel myself making somethig a habit I try to the best of my ability to break it .	"Mentorship , leadersh ip"	When I was on a varsity team my freshman year of high school and there was a girl who took interest in me and began mentoring me and i learned how important that was .	I hope to be an ESL teacher in an under-privledged hispanic schoola nd providde the same kind of support and leadership and growth to them \	an ESL teacher	The ability to help people function more comfortably in everyday life	becoming fluent in Spanish and studying English	Spanish	Very well . I work hard at it too	Professor Zuwiyahh	I know exactly what to expect in that class . He lays out very cut and dry what is expected and your performance and grade is a direct reflection of your work ethic . He values the language and is good at what he teaches .	Nannying	I want to ultimately be a mom one day and nannying is a little glimpse into that . It is also basically what Ive been doing for my little brother for years and years only now I get paid very well for it	My mom	Whatever she wanted . She has been doing too much for me for years and I would have her pick something just for her that would make her happy	"I love my mom , she deserves to be pampered because she does so much for everyone else ."	Kat	The most caring loyal concerned person I have ever met . She is constantly worried about others and is much cooler than I am . She is kind of a hippie . she is very laid back and loves music and art and talking about important things like political issues and ethics and philosophy . She loves no matter what and even talking about her right now makes me want to give her a big hug	She understands me and loves who I am not for anything I do but just for me . She is supportive and constantly interested in making sure I know through quality time how much she cares	I have been both at the bottom of the totem pole and at the top and as i do love to be in a leadership position I also understand and appreciate knowing when to be led by someone else .	An ideal partner would be someone with a very strong dedicated work ethic . It would be someone who knows that you cant always be better than someone else but you can always out work them . It would be someone confident in who they are and what their abilities are as well	"Yes i enjoy constructive criticism . My friends would probably say Im a friend who will always be there even though I may not have the best advice , it is very important to me that I am always there for my friends no matter what ."	"When my friend Waverly called me at 2 am because she has health problems and wasnt feeling well . I didnt know exactly what to do but i took her to the hospital and stayed there with her for hours on end , slept there and ran numerous errands to help her out ."	I am unorganized and I procrastinate	My room is very messy .

I'm stubborn but also loyal to those I care about . I have a hard time feeling empathy towards family and friends but I try to do what I can to help them out .	"Usually with friends , girlfriend , or spending time to myself playing video games or exercising ."	I like	I grew up watching Star Wars on VHS tapes and was hooked as a child . I was fascinated with the idea of fighting bad guys with lightsabers and that child-like wonder has stuck with me through today .	I really enjoyed	Both have to deal with an era of time that I find fascinating . The Outsiders during the 50s when leather jackets and greased hair were the styles . Great Gatsby because the Roaring 20s seemed like a time when the world was rapidly changing and the American Dream was starting to become a reality .	Both books were through school readings in english class during high school .	I have always wondered	I would probably also enjoy the mountains of northern California and try skiing .	Sometimes I feel that the truth isn't important in certain situations . And sometimes I have to lie in order to keep some things secret that I promised I would keep secret .	A habit of mine that isn't great is that I always have a messy living space . My room is always disorganized and sometimes I will lose clothes or items for weeks at a time .	Sports	My family has always been big into sports . I was playing soccer at the age of 4 and continued to play until middle school when I picked up football . Both my father and brother played college football here at Auburn .	"I tried out for the Auburn football team this past January at their walk-on tryouts . I didn't make it , in fact I don't believe anyone did . But I am going to train over the summer to try out again in the fall ."	I want to be a Physical Therapist	I want to work around sports . Working in physical therapy will give me the opportunity to find a position that deals with sports related injuries .	"Not bad , but not great either . School is going alright but I need to have better grades than alright . And I haven't had any shadowing practice yet and many PT schools want you to have plenty of shadowing experience ."	My favorite courses have been Anatomy and History .	"I received an A in history 1 , and a B in history 2 . I will get a B in both Anatomy 1 and 2 ."	"My anatomy professor , Dr . Farris . He makes the class very interesting and enjoyable , even when its an 8am class . He is very relatable to me and my fellow students ."	"He uses memes in his slideshows . Seriously . Sometimes they are lame but other times he nails it . He is hilarious , and cares about how his students do in the class ."	Working as a lifeguard .	"The job I had was very easy and relaxed . I got free lunch when I worked , we barely had any patrons come during the day , and I was working with one of my best friends ."	"Myself , in a way . I would pay for the tuition of the summer class I am taking over this summer so that my dad wouldn't have to pay for it out of his own pockets ."	"My summer tuition , so that he could put the money away for something else he would want to do with it ."	"Because my dad has always supported me financially and I would like to repay him in some ways , even if they are minuscule ."	"That depends , because I have some great guy friends and then I have my girlfriend who I am currently closest with . But for the sake of having an answer , lets say my buddy Austin ."	"Outgoing and hilarious . He is always coming up with crazy ideas for fun . Whether it be making a dessert for a dessert competition that is entirely comprised of gummy worms and oreos , or shooting water balloons at people as they walk to their dorm , or playing gold around campus ."	We both are guys who love fun and we love Jesus and have bonded over these two big aspects over the past year .	I am one who likes to lead not by words but by example and action .	Someone who much more extroverted than I am to get the ball rolling . A few hard workers and someone who can give moral support when things get tough .	"Loyal , funny , helpful"	"At church camps where I have been a counselor before , I was always helping more than I needed to ."	"I'm late , often not motivated , too lackadaisical ."

I like to think of myself as a pretty easy-going person . I enjoy being with friends for the entirety of my day . I rarely get upset or angry unless I am playing sports , in which I tend to become overly competitive ."	I like to hang out with friends and just kind of go with the flow .	My favorite TV show is either How I Met Your Mother or That 70's Show .	They're just funny and easy to laugh with .	I'd probably have to say Percy Jackson .	"I just like the whole idea of mythology intertwined with normal life ,"	It was just really popular in my school at the time I found it . guess I heard about it from a friend .	"i My bad haha I would probably like to live out in the Western US . People seem way less judgmental of others decisions than here in the Southeast , which I would greatly appreciate ."	Hanging out at the beach or the mountains . Probably drinking some with my friends on the weekends .	Because honestly I lie to my mother all the time . She's a very Southern Baptist lady and some of our ideals just don't line up . I don' t want to make her unhappy or worried though so I just tell her what she wants to hear sometimes .	I tend to be too lazy . I smoke cigarettes a few times a week which I know is super unhealthy . And honestly I dont live as healthy of a lifestyle as I wish I did .	People and how they feel	"I used to not have many friends and I was ok with that . But then when I started making some , I realized how much I love being around people"	"Well I'm the Vice President of Membership for my Fraternity , which basically means I'm the guy in charge of meeting and talking to all the new students that come around , and deciding which guys I think would be a good fit for our organization"	Happy	It's not a job haha silly computer . No matter what I end up doing I just want to enjoy the people around me that I'm doing it with .	Pretty well I'd say . I've met a ton of connections with outstanding individuals in my time at college that I feel will benefit me once I graduate .	Mathematics	I got a C in Differential Equations so that stinks but I got super sick right before my final which dropped me down from a B . I've gotten B's or better on all my calculus classes though .	I actually don' t remember his full last name but everyone calls him Professor ChuChu .	"He was just a funny guy that also really understood the material and wanted to see all of his students succeed , without him being to soft on anyone . I could tell he had a real passion for people and also Calculus and I appreciated that ."	Being a receptionist for a medical clinic .	I got to talk to a lot of individuals and try to brighten their days up . Also because I really loved my bosses and co-workers .	My mother	I guess if i absolutely have to spend that money on a gift for her I'd probably use it to help renovate our mess of a basement .	"Because I wouldn't be where I am today without her in my life , and I know our basement is one of the things that stresses her out the most ."	Caspian roberts	He's super outgoing . He loves to talk to everybody and get to know anyone around him . He's also very driven to be succesful .	Probably just because we share a love for talking to people around us . And also because I just really enjoy his sense of humor .	I'll take the lead if nobody in the group seems competent enough to handle it . But if I sense a natural leader in the group I tend to try and take the number two role in things .	"One natural leader who was good at allocating jobs and managing time , and a second individual who was well versed in the content we were working on , but was down to do whatever was needed for the group ."	"Super outgoing , trustworthy , friendly to everyone ."	"When I was studying at the library last night with one of my close friends , I had about ten to twenty other people I was friends with come up and say hello to me within a half hour of being there ."	I can be pretty lazy	I messed up some last semester and thought I had my grades under control when I really didn't . I ended up doing much worse than I was hopinng for .	The ability to talk to anyone and keep a positive yet logical outlook when listening to other people's problems	My GPA last semester	My confidence ( the thing you said I don't have . . . ) and my sense of humor .
